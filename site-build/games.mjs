// Game registry for docs.lakesidegames.net.
//
// A House Divided owns the site root and is built by build.mjs, which pulls its
// pages from the game repo's wiki seed plus this repo's design/engineering/api
// trees. Every other game is a "satellite": a curated list of markdown files in
// its own repo, rendered by build-game.mjs into /g/<slug>/ with the same theme.
//
// Curation is deliberate and explicit rather than a directory glob. These repos
// are private and their docs trees mix player-facing design with deploy runbooks
// and status reports; a glob would publish the runbooks. Every file listed below
// was read and cleared. Files NOT listed are excluded on purpose — see the
// `excluded` note on each game for the ones that were rejected and why.

// This registry is published in a public repo, so it carries no server paths.
// rebuild-lakeside-docs.sh supplies the real locations; the fallbacks assume a
// sibling-checkout layout so a fresh clone still resolves something sane.
