# Interbank Lending and Bank Resolution

This covers three related pieces of the private banking system: the interbank market and central-bank margin line (`src/lib/banking/interbank.ts`), what happens to a bank's outstanding loan book after it fails (`src/lib/banking/deadBankLoans.ts`), and the NPP-run banks that seed into every eligible country (`src/lib/banking/npcBanks.ts`). All three sit inside the wider private banking system in `src/lib/banking/`, which also covers charters, deposits, reserves, capital adequacy, the discount window, and deposit insurance (not documented here). Every path in this doc is gated behind `privateBankingEnabled` on `gameConfig`, which the ops notes describe as currently OFF in production; the code confirms the gate exists (`src/lib/banking/featureFlag.ts`) but this doc does not speak to current prod state beyond that.

## Feature Flags

`src/lib/banking/featureFlag.ts` defines three flags read off `gameConfig._id: "default"`:

- `isPrivateBankingEnabled`, master switch. Defaults to disabled; only an explicit `true` turns it on.
- `isBankPropTradingEnabled`, requires banking on; absent/undefined defaults to enabled. Gates interbank lending and the CB margin line.
- `isBankContagionEnabled`, requires banking on; absent/undefined defaults to enabled. Gates failure contagion (not covered by the three files here).

`lendInterbank`, `repayInterbank`, `drawCbMargin`, and `repayCbMargin` all check `isPrivateBankingEnabled() && isBankPropTradingEnabled()` and return an error if either is false. The two interbank API routes (`bank/interbank/loans`, `bank/interbank/margin`) separately gate on `isBankPropTradingEnabled()` and return 404 if off.

NPC bank seeding (`seedNpcBanks`) is explicitly NOT gated on `privateBankingEnabled`, charters are issued through the real `issueCharter` path with a `skipFlagCheck` bypass, so NPC banks exist in the world regardless of the flag. Runtime NPC bank behavior (`processNpcBankPolicyTurn`, the turn-phase entry point) IS gated: it no-ops and returns a zero summary when private banking is off.

## Interbank Lending (`interbank.ts`)

A deposit-taking bank (retail or universal charter) lends non-reserved cash to a bank running a prop book (investment or universal charter). This is separate from a retail bank's ordinary loan book: interbank loans are not part of `totalLoans` and are tracked on their own `InterbankLoan` documents plus a running `bankCharter.interbankDebt` on the borrower.

### Eligibility

- Lender must have an active retail or universal charter (`isDepositTakingCharter`).
- Borrower must have an active investment or universal charter (`isPropBorrowerCharter`).
- Lender and borrower charter currencies must match.
- A bank cannot lend to itself.

### Sizing constraints

```
INTERBANK_MAX_SHARE_OF_LENDABLE = 0.5   // provisional
```

Lendable headroom is computed via `getLendableHeadroom(lenderCharter, reserveRatio)` (see `reserves.ts`), where `reserveRatio = getReserveRequirement(db, currency)`. The lender may place at most `0.5 x headroom` on the interbank market, checked as a running total across all of that lender's current interbank loans (`sumLenderInterbankOutstanding`, summed over `status: "current"`). A new loan is rejected if it alone exceeds the cap, or if adding it to already-outstanding interbank lending would exceed the cap. Separately, the lender must have enough liquid `cashReserves` to cover the amount.

### Origination (`lendInterbank`)

Cash moves lender reserves -> borrower reserves. An `InterbankLoan` document is created:

```ts
{
  lenderCorporationId, borrowerCorporationId, currency,
  principal, outstanding, ratePercent, originatedTurn,
  status: "current"
}
```

The write sequence is: insert loan -> debit lender `bankCharter.cashReserves` (conditioned on `cashReserves >= amount`) -> credit borrower `cashReserves` and increment `bankCharter.interbankDebt`. Each step is guarded and the function unwinds (deletes the loan doc, refunds the lender) if a later step's conditional update fails to match, since the code notes standalone Mongo has no transactions. A `bank_interbank_lend` transaction is emitted via `emitTx`.

### Repayment (`repayInterbank`)

Repays principal only, capped at `min(amount, loan.outstanding)`. Cash moves borrower -> lender; `bankCharter.interbankDebt` and `loan.outstanding` both decrease by the repaid amount. If the lender-credit step fails after the borrower has already been debited, the code compensates by crediting the cash and debt back onto the borrower rather than losing it. Loan status flips to `"repaid"` once `outstanding <= 0`; `arrearsTurns` resets to 0 on any repayment.

### Interest servicing (turn-phase, `bankingTurn.ts`)

`serviceInterbankAndCbMargin` runs every banking turn (idempotent via `lastProcessedTurn !== turn`), independent of whether any deposit-taking bank needs a servicing pass. It processes every `InterbankLoan` with `status: "current"`.

Per loan (`serviceOneInterbankLoan`):

```
interestDue = outstanding x (ratePercent / 100) / TURNS_PER_YEAR   // TURNS_PER_YEAR = 48
payment = min(interestDue, borrower's available cashReserves)
```

- If `payment` covers `interestDue` (within 1e-9), full interest is paid borrower -> lender via `payInterbankInterest`, `arrearsTurns` resets to 0.
- If not, the shortfall is a partial payment: whatever cash is available is paid, `arrearsTurns` increments by 1.
  - If `arrearsTurns >= ARREARS_DEFAULT_TURNS` (= 8, same constant used for player loan defaults), the loan is written off: no cash moves for the remaining principal, the borrower's `bankCharter.interbankDebt` is reduced by the outstanding amount, and loan status becomes `"defaulted"`.
  - Below that threshold, only `arrearsTurns` and `lastProcessedTurn` update; the loan stays `"current"`.

Interest payments are logged via `emitTx`/`payInterbankInterest` moving cash on both bank charters' `cashReserves`.

### Lender-side failure (bankSolvencyTurn.ts)

If the LENDER on an interbank loan fails, `writeOffLenderSideInterbankOnFailure` marks every `InterbankLoan` where that corp is `lenderCorporationId` and `status: "current"` as `"defaulted"`. The code is explicit that the borrower keeps the cash and the loss is absorbed as an unrecoverable write-off on the failed lender's estate; chasing the borrower for early repayment is treated as compounding one failure into a second. This function does NOT touch claims against the failed bank (i.e. where it is the borrower), those are settled separately, in priority order, by `returnDepositBook` during the resolution sweep.

### CB margin line

A separate facility: prop-book-collateralized borrowing directly from the country's central bank, available to the same investment/universal charters.

```
CB_MARGIN_SPREAD_PP = 1.5                 // provisional
cbMarginRatePercent(primeRate) = max(0, primeRate + 1.5)

CB_MARGIN_COLLATERAL_FRACTION = 0.5       // provisional
maxDebt = 0.5 x propBookMarkValue
```

`drawCbMargin`: collateral check is `cbMarginDebt + cbMarginArrears + amount <= maxDebt`, i.e. unpaid interest arrears count against the line's headroom too (the code notes this is deliberate, a bank that cannot service the margin loses headroom rather than silently borrowing its own arrears). On draw, cash is CREATED into `bankCharter.cashReserves` (`+amount`) and `bankCharter.cbMarginDebt` increases by the same amount; the country's `centralBanks.netMoneyCreatedLifetime` increases correspondingly. This mirrors the discount window: originating the loan does not debit any CB pool.

`repayCbMargin`: repay amount is `min(amount, cbMarginDebt, cashReserves)`. Cash is DESTROYED from the bank's reserves (mirror of creation on draw) and `netMoneyCreatedLifetime` decreases by the same amount.

Both draw and repay emit `bank_cb_margin_draw` / `bank_cb_margin_repay` transactions with the counterparty recorded as `"{country} central bank"`.

### API surface

- `POST /api/corporations/[id]/bank/interbank/loans`, originate a loan (CEO of lender only). Body: `{ borrowerCorporationId, amount, ratePercent }`. Gated by `isBankPropTradingEnabled`; returns 404 if off.
- `POST /api/corporations/[id]/bank/interbank/margin`, `{ action: "draw" | "repay", amount }` (CEO only). Same gate.
- `GET /api/banking/corporation/[id]` also surfaces interbank state as part of the general bank read model.

## Dead Bank Loans (`deadBankLoans.ts`)

Handles loans a FAILED or REVOKED bank made as a LENDER that were never resolved when the charter died. The module's own comment states the prior behavior explicitly: the banking turn only services banks with an `active` charter, so once a bank's charter left that state its outstanding loan book simply stopped being serviced, borrowers stopped paying, the asset sat at full value on a dead charter forever, and any recovery reached nobody.

### Which banks qualify

`findDeadBanksWithLoans` selects every corporation with `bankCharter.status` in `["failed", "revoked"]`. Each is marked `resolved: true` if either:
- `bankCharter.status === "revoked"` (a revoked charter has already run the resolution waterfall on its way out), or
- `bankCharter.depositorsResolvedTurn` is a set number (a failed charter's resolution sweep has stamped it).

### Where recovered cash goes (`recoveryTargetFor`)

- **Not yet resolved**: payment lands in the dead bank's own `bankCharter.cashReserves`, i.e. the estate. This makes the resolution waterfall (which distributes that cash) bigger if a recovery arrives before it runs.
- **Resolved**: the dead bank's depositors were already made whole by deposit insurance / the treasury backstop, and the owner already took any residual. A late recovery is treated as subrogation and is paid into the `depositInsuranceFunds` document for that currency (`balance` field), not to the bank or its owner. `ensureFund` is called first to guarantee the currency's insurance fund document exists before crediting it.

### Servicing loop (`processDeadBankLoans`, called from `bankingTurn.ts`)

For each dead bank, it queries `bankLoans` for that `bankCorporationId` where `borrowerType` is `character` or `corporation`, `status` in `["current", "arrears"]`, and `lastProcessedTurn !== turn` (idempotency guard). If there are matching loans, it resolves the target (estate or insurer) and then services each loan SERIALLY within that bank (not in parallel), because two loans from the same borrower must see each other's debit exactly as the live per-bank servicing path does. The actual per-loan collection math (interest, arrears, principal) is injected as a `serviceLoan` callback from `bankingTurn.ts` rather than owned by this module, specifically so this file does not depend on the turn file that depends on it.

Returned summary: `{ loansServiced, recoveredToEstate, recoveredToInsurer }`, all zero if there are no dead banks with loans.

## NPC Banks (`npcBanks.ts`)

NPP-owned (non-player-party) retail banks seeded into eligible countries to give the private banking system counterparties and market depth without requiring player-run banks in every country.

### Seeding (`seedNpcBanks`)

```
NPC_BANKS_PER_COUNTRY = 2                        // provisional
NPC_BANK_CAPITAL_BUFFER_MULTIPLIER = 3            // provisional
```

For every country in `ALL_COUNTRY_IDS`:
- Skipped (counted as `skippedIneligible`) if the country has no configured NPP capital HQ state (`NPP_CAPITAL_STATES`), no mapped currency, or the country's legal charter types (`getLegalCharterTypes`) do not include `"retail"`.
- Otherwise, up to 2 bank slots are seeded, keyed deterministically by `npcBankSeedKey(countryId, index)` = `"npc-bank:{countryId}:{index}"` for idempotency.
- Starting capital is `getCharterCapitalRequirement(currency) x 3`: one multiple is posted into the charter itself, the remaining two are described as the working treasury buffer.
- Bank names are drawn from era-flavored template lists (`COUNTRY_HISTORICAL_NAMES` / `COUNTRY_MODERN_NAMES`, keyed by country, falling back to generic defaults), selected by whether the era's `loadWorldEraUnitScale(db) > 1` (historical vs. modern naming). The code comments emphasize these are generic patterns, not real institution names.
- Each new corp is spawned via `spawnNppCorporation` (type `"financial"`) and then chartered via `issueCharter(db, corpId, "retail", currency, { skipFlagCheck: true })`. Charter failures are counted separately from corp-creation failures.
- There is a name+country fallback lookup (`ceoType: "npp", type: "financial"`) for corps that exist without the seed key from a prior run, which backfills the key and issues a charter if one isn't already active.

Seeding itself is NOT gated on `privateBankingEnabled` (comment: "gameConfig is never mutated", the bypass is scoped to charter issuance only, not a flag flip). Runtime turn behavior is gated (see below).

### Runtime rate policy (`runNpcBankPolicy` / `processNpcBankPolicyTurn`)

Turn-phase entry point `processNpcBankPolicyTurn` (registered as phase `npcBankPolicyTurn` in `src/simulation/phases/turnPhaseRegistry.ts`) no-ops with a zero summary (`{ banksChecked: 0, banksUpdated: 0 }`) if `isPrivateBankingEnabled()` is false. It does NOT seed banks; seeding is a separate admin/bootstrap-time operation (`src/lib/admin/seed/seedNpcBanks.ts`, `src/lib/admin/bootstrapGameWorld.ts`).

When enabled, `runNpcBankPolicy` iterates every corp with `ceoType: "npp"`, active `bankCharter`, and charter type `retail` or `universal`. For each, it fetches the country's rate corridors (`getRateCorridors`) and computes the midpoint of the deposit and lending offset ranges. If the bank's current `depositOffset`/`lendingOffset` has drifted from that midpoint by more than `1e-9`, it resets both to the midpoint via `setBankRates`. This is described as keeping NPC banks pinned to the corridor center; it does not set the reserve-holding or loan-book behavior, which the comment says comes from `bankingTurn`'s NPC flows (not covered by this file).
