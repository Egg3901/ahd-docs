# Commodities

Commodities model inputs and outputs between corporate sectors. Prices move with global and regional supply and demand, and feed into sector profit margins.

Supply is not an abstract number: under the live market mode (`marketSystemMode: "plants"`, see [[The Capacity Economy (as shipped)]]) a sector's commodity output comes from real plant capacity it built and staffed. A sector still under construction, or mothballed, contributes nothing to supply even though it exists on paper. Sold units, not nameplate revenue, are what move the D/S ratio below. Beyond the margin modifiers described here, commodity prices also scale sector revenue directly through **price realization** (see that section below), and under the deeper clearing/capital tiers, revenue itself is derived from what capacity actually sold, not asserted from a growth rate. See [[The Capacity Economy (as shipped)]] and the in-game [Market System guide](/wiki/market-system-guide) for the full production side of this loop.

## Overview

28 commodity types trade across the economy:

| Category       | Commodities                                                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Extractable    | Iron Ore, Coal, Crude Oil, Rare Earth Minerals (merged with copper), Natural Gas, Timber                                             |
| Industrial     | Steel, Electronics, Chemicals, Plastics, Ordnance                                                                                     |
| Energy & Fuels | Electricity (Energy), Fertilizers, Pharmaceuticals, Vehicles                                                                          |
| Food           | Food Products                                                                                                                         |
| Construction   | Building Materials, Construction Services                                                                                             |
| Services       | Software, Financial Services, Healthcare Services, Real Estate Services, Advertising, Consulting Services, Freight, Retail, Network Services, Entertainment Services |

Each sector type supplies and demands specific commodities at rates tied to sector revenue. **Retail** demands many inputs and supplies the Consumer Goods (`retail`) commodity. Only **owned** corporate sectors participate in a state's commodity flow.

## Pricing

Each turn, prices update from supply and demand using logarithmic scaling with no hard cap:

```
ratio = demand / supply
if ratio >= 1: price = basePrice × (1 + 0.7 × ln(ratio))    # shortage
else:          price = basePrice / (1 + 0.7 × ln(1/ratio))   # oversupply
```

Blended price for display: **50% global** + **25% national** (country aggregate) + **25% regional** (state-level). A global stabilizer (`BASE_COMMODITY_SUPPLY_DEMAND = 50,000`) on each side prevents extreme swings. A national stabilizer (`NATIONAL_COMMODITY_STABILIZER = 500`) prevents degenerate ratios in small countries.

Raw supply/demand pressure is compressed by a soft-knee before it reaches the price formula: pressure stays at full fidelity up to `COMMODITY_PRESSURE_SOFT_KNEE = 3` (3x shortage/oversupply), beyond which the tail is compressed at `COMMODITY_PRESSURE_TAIL_SLOPE = 0.25`. The six extractable resources (iron, coal, oil, natural gas, timber, rare earth) use a wider knee for PRICE math only, `EXTRACTABLE_PRESSURE_SOFT_KNEE = 8`, so scarcity in those markets keeps signalling further before compression kicks in. Margin math always uses the default 3x knee, even for extractables.

Macro-driven commodities (financial services, healthcare services, advertising, real estate services) use a 50/50 global/national blend because state-level activity is meaningless for nationally-driven demand.

## Margins

Margin modifiers are computed independently at global, national, and state level, then blended 50/25/25, matching the price blend:

```
globalMod   = -K × Σ(rate_i × ln(D_global_i / S_global_i))
nationalMod = -K × Σ(rate_i × ln(D_national_i / S_national_i))
stateMod    = -K × Σ(rate_i × ln(D_state_i / S_state_i))
rawMod = 0.5 × globalMod + 0.25 × nationalMod + 0.25 × stateMod
```

With `COMMODITY_LOG_K = 40`, shortages are meaningful but manageable:

| Scenario (rate=0.25) | Ratio | Margin hit |
| -------------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Mild shortage        | 1.1×  | -1.0%      |
| Moderate             | 1.4×  | -3.4%      |
| Severe               | 2.0×  | -6.9%      |
| Extreme              | 5.0×  | -16.1%     |

Sellers in scarce markets get an equivalent **surplus bonus** (same formula, positive sign).

**Per-commodity soft cap:** No single commodity can contribute more than ±50 percentage points to the modifier (`COMMODITY_PER_ITEM_CAP = 50`).

**Aggregate caps:** After blending, the combined input modifier is floored at `−COMMODITY_AGGREGATE_INPUT_CAP (30)` and the surplus modifier is ceilinged at `+COMMODITY_AGGREGATE_SURPLUS_CAP (30)`. This prevents stacked multi-commodity pressure from commercially destroying a sector under routine market conditions.

**State stabilizers:** A state-level stabilizer prevents extreme ratios when a state has zero local supply, applied only in the margin path (state prices remain fully dynamic).

- Standard commodities: `STATE_COMMODITY_SUPPLY_DEMAND = 250`
- Extractable resources (oil, gas, iron, timber, coal, rare earth, rare earth also covers copper): `EXTRACTABLE_RESOURCE_STATE_STABILIZER = 2500`, these are globally traded so local absence doesn't mean local unavailability.

**Retail penalty:** Retail sectors take only **25%** of negative input penalties (`RETAIL_NEGATIVE_COMMODITY_PENALTY_FACTOR`), reflecting substitution power.

## Price realization

Beyond the margin modifiers above, commodity prices scale sector revenue directly (when the market system tier is enabled):

```
factor = clamp((price / basePrice) ^ 0.5, 0.7, 1.5)
sectorRealization = supply-rate-weighted mean of factors across a sector's outputs
realizedRevenue = baseRevenue × sectorRealization
```

Prices are lagged one turn to break the price-to-revenue-to-supply feedback loop, and the per-turn shock is bounded to [-30%, +50%]. This is on top of, not instead of, the margin modifiers: shortages now reward producers with more top-line revenue, not just a better margin percentage, and gluts bleed revenue even when the margin looks tolerable.
