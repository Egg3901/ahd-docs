# Japan - Government Structure

## Overview

Japan is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The Emperor is a ceremonial head of state with no political power. The Prime Minister leads government through confidence in the House of Representatives (Shugiin), the lower chamber of the bicameral National Diet.

## National Diet (Legislature)

### House of Representatives (Shugiin)

- **465 seats** allocated by Hare-quota PR across 8 regional constituencies
- **4-year terms**, but can be dissolved by the PM for snap elections
- Invests confidence in the Cabinet - the PM must command a Shugiin majority
- Bills may originate in the Shūgiin, the Sangiin, or Cabinet review; the Shūgiin has override power over the Sangiin (2/3 supermajority)

### House of Councillors (Sangiin)

- **248 seats** allocated by Hare-quota PR on staggered 6-year terms
- Half elected every 3 game years (2 classes, alternating)
- Cannot be dissolved - provides legislative continuity
- Revises and can reject legislation, but Shugiin override is available

## Executive

- Appointed via confidence vote in the Shugiin (lower house only)
- No fixed term - serves until losing confidence, resigning, or snap election
