# The Granular Layer-1 Electorate (as shipped)

The electorate that casts votes in A House Divided is not the 12 voter archetypes any more: it is a lattice of granular demographic cells, the cross-product of Layer-1 census dimensions (race, age, education, wealth in the US; ethnicity, income, urbanization variants abroad), IPF-raked to each state's census marginals. This is the live vote path for every country, not a proposal or a flag: the `granularElectorateEnabled` OFF branch has been removed from the tally engine, and a null substrate now means only "this state has no census row yet". The core is `src/lib/demographics/granularElectorate.ts`. This document supersedes `design/demographics.md` and the two `demographic-election-*audit.md` documents where they describe the archetype electorate or a flag-gated granular path as current.

## Cells, units, and the substrate

`buildGranularElectorateSubstrate` produces a drop-in replacement for the legacy engine inputs: a synthetic `DemographicCategory` (id `granularCells`), a `StateDemographics` whose "groups" are cells, live turnouts, and a turnout pool. The vote-distribution engines (`voteDistribution.ts`, `voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`) are unchanged: they iterate whatever groups they are handed, so the appeal formula (policy-distance dominance, favorability weighting, org/reg/support multipliers) applies to cells exactly as it did to archetypes.

Derivation, per state (`deriveCellsForState` then `coalesceCells`):

1. **Derive cells.** US states use the state census config plus resolved position tables; other countries use their seeded `CountryLayer1Model` (every country has one). When the era clock is live (`gameState.currentYear` set), census marginals, positions, and turnout rates are resolved for the YEAR, sliding between era anchors (`eraSubstrateForYear.ts`); failures degrade to the frozen-preset lookup with a recorded fallback, never a thrown turn.
2. **Prune.** Cells below `ELECTORATE_PRUNE_FLOOR` = 0.0025 (0.25% of the electorate) are dropped and the rest renormalized.
3. **Coalesce.** Surviving cells merge into units on quantized leans and turnout (`LEAN_QUANT` = 0.5 on the shared −5..+5 axes, `TURNOUT_QUANT` = 5 points), storing share-weighted means and share-weighted `bucketWeights` ("dim:key" → 0..1). Appeal depends only on a unit's leans, so coalescing is the memoization: each distinct quantized lean pair is scored once per candidate.
4. **Memoize.** Unit lists are cached per (country, state, preset, turnout-modifier signature, overlay signatures, year), `UNIT_CACHE_MAX` = 800 entries. The year and the durable overlays are part of the key because they change the derivation itself.

Unit turnout is clamped to [5, 95]; bucket rates feeding the geometric mean are clamped to [1, 99].

## Turnout rates and the vote pool

Base bucket turnout comes from `DEMOGRAPHIC_TURNOUT_RATES` in `src/lib/seeds/demographicCategories.ts` (modern national baselines: race white 63 / black 60 / hispanic 48; age young 38 / mid 56 / mature 66 / senior 76; education no_college 52 / college 66 / graduate 74; wealth low 44 / middle 60 / high 74), replaced by era-resolved tables when the year clock is live. A cell's turnout is the geometric mean of its buckets' rates, rescaled so the population-weighted mean matches the state baseline. GOTV, canvassing, and suppression modifiers compose in three ways: US dim-keyed modifiers add directly to bucket rates; archetype-keyed modifiers project onto buckets via the archetype map; non-US archetype-keyed modifiers scale every cell by the state's aggregate live-vs-static ratio (magnitude preserved, per-group targeting not). Ideology-dim modifiers have no cell axis and are dropped on the granular path (documented limitation).

The substrate's `totalPool` is Σ over units of `statePopulation × share × turnout`, where the population basis is `state.votingEligiblePopulation` when the cohort vectors exist. In `src/lib/electionEngine/tallyManagement.ts` this pool replaces `resolveTurnout().totalPool` and is spread across the general-phase turn window by `turnVoteWeight`, then scaled by state approval and office strength.

Registration enters separately, per party, from `statePartyOrg` rows: `registration` feeds `regResistanceMultiplier` (Phase 5a persuasion resistance: entrenched registration resists peel), and `registrationShare` feeds `regBaselineMultiplier` on worlds whose seeds author partisan baselines (UK era polling). Rows without the fields resolve to a neutral 1.0×.

## Mapping archetypes onto cells

Gameplay systems still author effects against archetypes: character and NPP `archetypeApprovals`, legislation `demographicEffects`, Address-driven party-group favorability, GOTV modifiers. `src/lib/demographics/archetypeBucketMap.ts` projects each of the 12 US archetypes onto 2 or 3 census buckets with weights summing to exactly 1.0 (retirees: age:senior 0.7 + age:mature 0.3; new_immigrants: race:hispanic 0.5 + race:asian 0.3 + race:other 0.2; ideology-dominant archetypes like evangelicals are approximated by census correlates). `archetypeValuesToBuckets` distributes a value V as V × w per bucket; a unit then picks up Σ bucketWeight × bucketValue, so a cell matching all of an archetype's buckets receives the full value and partial matches a proportional fraction. Non-US countries project through their own seeded `composition` tables (`countryArchetypeBuckets.ts`); archetype ids with no mapping are counted in `getUnmappedArchetypeDrops` rather than silently vanishing. Candidate approvals and `${partyId}:${archetypeId}` favorability deltas are remapped onto unit keys through the same projection, clamped to [−100, 100].

Ordinary legislation lean drift still works: the per-archetype delta (live `stateDemographics` minus the seeded `demographicDefaults` snapshot) is projected onto buckets and folded into unit leans, clamped to the −5..+5 axis. That fold is deliberately zero-sum for anything that moves live and default together, which is exactly why realignments need their own channel.

## Era checkpoints: durable realignment

`src/lib/demographics/eraCheckpoints.ts` declares dated, historically anchored pulls; `src/lib/turn/eraCheckpointTurn.ts` applies them each turn, strictly after `demographicEffects` in the `stateEffectsAndNationalAggregation` phase (both `$set` the same fields, so concurrency would race a lost update). The registry (`ERA_CHECKPOINTS`) currently ships seven US checkpoints: the Southern Realignment (triggered by Brown v. Board's docket outcome, 15 years × 48 turns, shifting Deep South `rural_traditionalists`/`evangelicals` right by up to +4.0 economic and the `race:white` bucket directly), the national Civil Rights Act Black consolidation (race:black, −2.5 economic / −1.5 social, all states), the Voting Rights Act enfranchisement (a TURNOUT-axis shift: +40 points for race:black in MS and AL, +20 in LA/GA/SC/VA over 3 years), and Engel, Reynolds, Griswold, and Miranda lean nudges. Checkpoints only run in worlds with `startingYear` 1953.

Mechanics:

- A target's per-turn pull is `totalShift / durationTurns`. SCOTUS-gated checkpoints start at the case's `decidedAtTurn` when it affirms history and fall back to a later `fallbackStartTurn` when it diverges: a differently composed Court slows history, it does not erase it.
- **Gravity, not rails.** Opposing legislative shifts on the same target net against the pull at `COUNTER_PRESSURE_MULTIPLIER` = 1, so a sustained countervailing law can cancel or reverse a checkpoint in a targeted state. Same-direction legislation is not double-counted.
- **Three substrates move from the same netted delta.** (1) The archetype leans on both `stateDemographics` and `demographicDefaults`, in lockstep, which relocates the resting point without fighting the decay-to-baseline channel and keeps the legacy read paths (state lean, position editor, wiki) moving. (2) A durable per-(dimension, bucket) delta on `demographicDefaults.layer1PositionOverrides`, the only channel the granular vote path reads a checkpoint through: `applyPositionOverlay` adds it to the resolved position table BEFORE cell derivation, so it moves the actual base value a cell's lean is averaged from, and it is never decayed. (3) For turnout-axis targets, `layer1TurnoutOverrides`, applied by `applyTurnoutRateOverlay` to the composed bucket-rate table before derivation, the enfranchisement channel.
- Bucket-kind targets (`dim` + `bucket`, e.g. race:white × the Deep South) write only the overlays: precise Layer-1 targeting with no archetype proxy. `checkpointBakedShifts.ts` de-duplicates each checkpoint's `historicalWindow` out of the interpolated era baselines so the shift is not applied twice.

## Vote accumulation through the election engine

The turn phase `voteAccumulation` (`accumulateGeneralElectionVotes` in `src/lib/turn/primaryResolution.ts`, group 5 of the turn processor) finds every active election in its general phase (no upper bound on `endTime`, so the final turn's votes are never dropped) and calls into `tallyManagement.ts` per election. There the substrate is built once per state and swapped in for demographics, categories, live turnouts, pool, enriched candidates, and favorability; the turn's vote slice then flows through `distributeVotesByGroupLevelAllocation` or `distributeVotesBySwingFlow` over the units, and the resulting per-candidate votes are added to the persistent `ElectionVoteTally`. Later phases in the same sequential group (`primarySnapshots`, `electionResolution`) resolve races from those accumulated tallies. Presidential races (`presidentialElectionEngine.ts`), primary stagger waves (`primaryStaggerPhase.ts`), and the cached state-lean read (`cachedStateLean.ts`) consume the same substrate, so polls, leans, and votes cannot disagree about who the electorate is.

The demographics tab reads the same units too: `src/lib/demographics/bucketProfile.ts` aggregates per-bucket share, leans, and turnout as share-weighted sums over `unit.bucketWeights`, so what the player sees is a projection of the exact electorate the engine counts, not a parallel archetype table.

## Turn-by-turn population mechanics

Two modules run every turn to keep the underlying population vectors (and the historical baseline they're compared against) internally consistent, independent of the vote-distribution machinery above.

### `cohortFlows.ts`, age×sex population advance

`advanceCohort()` (`src/lib/demographics/cohortFlows.ts`) advances one region's age×sex population vector (`AgeSexVector`) by one turn, in a fixed order:

1. **Continuous aging** (`applyContinuousAging`), runs every turn, not gated on a year boundary: `1/turnsPerYear` of each age cohort graduates up each turn, smoothing the age structure rather than jumping it once a year.
2. **Mortality** (`applyMortality`), applies a healthcare-modified death rate (`healthcareMortalityModifier`) to the post-aging vector.
3. **Fertility** (`computeBirths` / `splitNewbornsBySex`), converts the `population.birthRate` index to a TFR via `birthRateIndexToTFR()` (anchored to the preset's `replacementTFR`), computes births from the surviving vector (excluding women in mandatory military service from the childbearing pool when `servingFemaleByAge` is supplied, the conscription interaction), and splits newborns by sex into age-0.
4. **International migration** (`applyInternationalMigration`), applies the region's allocated share of national net international migrants (can be negative), using a migrant age/sex profile derived from `migrantShareMale`.

All flows are per-cell non-negative except the international-migration step, which can change total headcount. There is no cross-region internal migration yet (tracked as a future phase). The function returns both the advanced vector and a `CohortFlowTallies` summary (`births`, `deaths`, `netMigration`) for turn reporting.

### `checkpointBakedShifts.ts`, de-duplicating era checkpoints against authored history

Era checkpoints (`eraCheckpoints.ts`, see above) model historical realignments as a live per-turn pull. But the era anchor tables they pull toward are themselves authored from real election results, which already contain that history baked in, e.g. Alabama's `race:white` economic lean is authored at −3.0 in 1953 and +2.5 in 1979, and that +5.5 swing IS the Southern Realignment. Interpolating between those anchors as a live baseline while ALSO running the checkpoint's durable overlay would double-count the same historical shift, pinning the state at the ±5 axis edge.

`bakedCheckpointBucketShifts(stateId, axis, year, startingYear, countryId)` computes exactly how much of each checkpoint's `totalShift` real history had already delivered by a given year (`historicalDeliveredFraction()`: 0 before the checkpoint's `historicalWindow` opens, linear inside it, 1 after it closes), summed per `"dim:key"` bucket. That amount is subtracted from the interpolated era baseline so that `interpolated baseline + durable overlay == the authored anchor` at every anchor point, with smooth movement between anchors. This only runs for `startingYear === 1953` worlds (`CHECKPOINT_SEED_YEAR`), the only preset where checkpoints fire at all, any other starting year returns an empty record and the authored anchors are used untouched. The subtraction uses real-world calendar years from `historicalWindow`, not in-world turn counts, so it stays a pure function of the year regardless of how a particular world's SCOTUS docket paced the underlying checkpoint.
