# National Metrics System

## Overview

The national metrics system has two layers. Schema and approval still use 10 `MetricCategoryId` buckets (including `population`) on each `stateMetrics` document. The live metric-engine registry (`METRIC_REGISTRY` in `src/lib/metricEngine/registry/index.ts`) is 74 nodes in 9 categories; there is no population registry file, and extra engine nodes include country-specific ones (`gcseAttainment`, `nhsWaitingTime`, `bbcTrust`, `bundeswehrReadiness`, and others). Each state has a `stateMetrics` document; population-weighted national averages are derived from those documents each turn and stored as special national-scope documents (`"federal"` for the US, `"uk_national"` for the UK).

National metrics serve two purposes: they power the national metrics page (rankings, distribution, approval ratings) and they feed into the government approval calculation. Approval still walks all 10 categories but skips some population/cohort metrics as approval terms (`populationGrowth`, `medianAge`, `sexRatio`, `dependencyRatio`); `migrationRate` is kept. Government approval, in turn, influences vote accumulation during elections. For the approval formula and named modifier conditions, see [Government Approval](./government-approval.md).

## Metric Categories

Approval `CATEGORIES` and the `stateMetrics` document still use 10 buckets. The lists below are the original seeded US-shaped fields on the document, not the full engine registry.

### Economic (6 metrics)

`unemploymentRate`, `medianIncome`, `gdpGrowth`, `povertyRate`, `costOfLiving`, `smallBusinessFormation`

### Education (6 metrics)

`highSchoolGradRate`, `universityEnrollment`, `testPerformance`, `educationSpending`, `literacyRate`, `workforceSkill`

The field is `universityEnrollment`, not `collegeEnrollment`, the metric was renamed/merged (#909) into a single higher-education enrolment metric whose model is country-appropriate (HS-grad-driven in the US; GCSE-driven elsewhere). `collegeEnrollment` no longer exists in the schema (`src/lib/metricEngine/registry/education.ts`).

### Healthcare (6 metrics)

`uninsuredRate`, `affordabilityIndex`, `physicianRate`, `lifeExpectancy`, `preventableMortality`, `publicHealthPreparedness`

### Infrastructure (6 metrics)

`roadCondition`, `broadbandAccess`, `publicTransit`, `waterQuality`, `powerGridReliability`, `infrastructureInvestmentGap`

### Public Safety (6 metrics)

`crimeRate`, `violentCrimeRate`, `policePerCapita`, `incarcerationRate`, `recidivismRate`, `publicSafetyConfidence`

### Environment (6 metrics)

`airQuality`, `renewableEnergy`, `carbonEmissions`, `recyclingRate`, `climateResilience`, `protectedLand`

### Social (6 metrics)

`socialMobility`, `incomeInequality`, `homelessnessRate`, `foodInsecurity`, `civicParticipation`, `socialCohesion`

### Governance (5 metrics)

`governmentTransparency`, `budgetBalance`, `corruptionIndex`, `voterTurnout`, `publicTrust`

### Population (4 metrics)

`populationGrowth`, `urbanizationRate`, `medianAge`, `migrationRate`

### Media & Information (5 metrics)

`mediaPolarization`, `disinformationRisk`, `pressFreedom`, `socialMediaSentiment`, `newsTrust`

Each metric value is stored as a `StateMetricValue` object: `{ value: number; trend?: number }`.

## State vs National vs Global

**State metrics** are the ground truth. Each state has one `stateMetrics` document keyed by its state ID (e.g., `"TX"`, `"CA"`). Policy effects and demographic effects write to these documents directly; the national aggregates are never written to by those systems.

**National aggregates** are population-weighted averages of state metrics. `computeNationalMetrics()` runs each turn after policy and demographic effects, iterating over all states for a given country and computing a weighted average for every metric key. The result is upserted into `stateMetrics` under the national-scope ID (`"federal"` or `"uk_national"`). These documents are excluded from all aggregation computations to avoid circular double-counting, `NATIONAL_SCOPE_IDS` is used as a filter wherever state-only data is needed.

**Global averages** are computed on-the-fly by `GET /api/country/[code]/metrics` when calculating national government approval. All state-only `stateMetrics` documents across all countries are averaged (again excluding national-scope docs), giving a cross-country baseline. The country's national averages are then compared against this global baseline using the same relative formula applied to states vs their national average. This prevents national approval from being structurally anchored near 50%, which would happen if state-relative scores were averaged directly.

## API Endpoints

**Note:** these routes live under the per-country app-router path `src/app/api/country/[code]/...`, not `/api/national/...`. The country is a path segment (`[code]`), not a query parameter.

### `GET /api/country/[code]/metrics`

The comprehensive metrics endpoint (`src/app/api/country/[code]/metrics/route.ts`, backed by `loadNationalMetrics()` in `src/lib/country/nationalMetrics.ts`). Parameters:

- `code`, path segment, any `CountryId` in `COUNTRY_CONFIGS` (not limited to US/UK)
- `category`, optional query-string filter to a single `MetricCategoryId`

**What it does:**

1. Fetches all states for the requested country, then their `stateMetrics` documents.
2. For each metric, computes: simple average, population-weighted average, min state, and max state.
3. Builds a ranked list of all states for each metric (direction-aware: lower-is-better metrics rank ascending, higher-is-better rank descending).
4. Computes per-state government approval (state metrics vs national averages) and active named modifiers.
5. Computes national government approval by fetching all state-only metrics globally (excluding national-scope docs) to form the global baseline, then comparing the country's population-weighted averages against it.

**Response shape:**

```ts
{
  categories: { [categoryId]: { [metricId]: { average, populationWeightedAverage, min, max } } };
  stateRankings: { [categoryId]: { [metricId]: { stateId, stateName, value, rank }[] } };
  totalPopulation: number;
  calculatedAt: string; // ISO timestamp
  governmentApproval: number;
  governmentApprovalBase: number;
  governmentApprovalModifiers: ActiveModifier[];
  stateApprovals: { stateId, stateName, approval, baseApproval, modifiers }[];
}
```

All values are computed on-the-fly from the current `stateMetrics` documents; nothing is read from the national-scope aggregate docs for this response (the aggregates computed during turn processing are used for history charting, not for this endpoint's per-metric breakdowns).

### `GET /api/country/[code]/approval`

A lightweight endpoint optimised for the approval chart widget (`src/app/api/country/[code]/approval/route.ts`, backed by `loadNationalApproval()` in `src/lib/country/nationalApproval.ts`). Parameters:

- `code`, path segment, any `CountryId` in `COUNTRY_CONFIGS`

**What it does:**

1. Fetches state IDs and populations for the country.
2. Computes `computeNationalAveragesFromMetrics()` over those state metrics.
3. Calls `calculateStateApproval()` for each state (state vs national average), then `calculateNationalApproval()`, a population-weighted average of state approval scores.
4. Reads the `governmentApprovals` collection for the persisted turn-by-turn `history` array.

**Response shape:**

```ts
{
  governmentApproval: number;
  history: Array<{ turn: number; approval: number; net: number }>;
}
```

The response is served with `Cache-Control: no-store, no-transform`, approval reflects the latest turn snapshot, so it is explicitly kept off any shared/CDN cache, matching the sibling metrics route.

Note: this endpoint calculates approval differently from `/api/country/[code]/metrics`. Here, national approval is the population-weighted average of state approvals (each state vs its own national average). The `/api/country/[code]/metrics` endpoint uses the country-vs-global-average approach instead. The `/api/country/[code]/approval` history reflects whichever method `snapshotApprovalHistory` uses at turn time, see [[Government Approval]] for the approval formula details.

## Turn Processing

Metrics are recomputed and snapshotted during the tail of each turn, all as `runPhase()` calls inside the `stateEffectsAndNationalAggregation` adapter (`src/simulation/phases/stateEffectsPhase.ts`), after all policy and demographic effects are applied. See [turn-processing.md](./turn-processing.md) for the full 13-adapter pipeline this sits in.

| Phase name           | Function                                        | Order                                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `policyEffects`      | `processStatePolicyEffects`                     | Writes state metric values                                   |
| `demographicEffects` | `processAllStateDemographics`                   | Adjusts state metrics from demographics                      |
| `nationalMetrics`    | `computeNationalMetrics`                        | Runs after policy/demographic effects, derives national aggregates from updated state metrics |
| `metricHistory`      | `snapshotMetricHistory`                         | Runs after nationalMetrics, appends current values to history arrays |
| `approvalSnapshot`   | `snapshotApprovalHistory` (US + UK in parallel) | Runs last, persists approval rating to `governmentApprovals` |

The metric history cap is 96 entries (2 in-game years). History for national-scope IDs (`"federal"`, `"uk_national"`) is also written to `stateMetricHistory` by `snapshotMetricHistory`, so the national metrics detail page can render turn-by-turn charts using the same code path as state pages.

## Database

### `stateMetrics` collection

One document per state (keyed by state ID string, e.g., `"TX"`) plus one per country national scope (`"federal"`, `"uk_national"`).

Key fields:

- `_id: string`, state ID or national-scope ID
- `economic`, `education`, `healthcare`, `infrastructure`, `publicSafety`, `environment`, `social`, `governance`, `population`, `mediaInformation`, category objects, each containing `{ value: number; trend?: number }` per metric
- `lastUpdated: Date`

National-scope documents have the same shape as state documents but contain population-weighted averages. They are filtered out of all aggregation queries using `NATIONAL_SCOPE_IDS`.

### `governmentApprovals` collection

One document per country, keyed by `CountryId` (e.g., `"US"`, `"UK"`). Snapshotted each turn.

Key fields from `GovernmentApproval`:

- `_id: CountryId`
- `countryId: CountryId`
- `approvalRating: number`, 0-100
- `disapprovalRating: number`, 0-100
- `netApproval: number`, `approvalRating − disapprovalRating`
- `source: "president_favorability" | "pm_favorability" | "aggregate"`, matches `CountryConfig.approvalSource`
- `history: Array<{ turn, approval, net }>`, capped at 20 entries (most recent last)
- `updatedAt: Date`

### `stateMetricHistory` collection

One document per state plus one per national-scope ID. Each document stores per-metric time-series arrays capped at 96 entries:

```ts
{
  _id: string; // state ID or national-scope ID
  economic: { unemploymentRate: [{ turn: number; value: number }, ...]; ... };
  // ... all other categories
}
```

Read by `getMetricHistory(db, stateId, category, metricId)` for chart rendering.

## Election Impact

Government approval feeds into the vote accumulation phase of general elections. See [[Government Approval]] for how approval is calculated and used. In brief: each turn, the vote pool for a race is scaled by `(1 + (approvalDecimal − 0.5) × 0.2) × officeStrength` (`tallyManagement.ts`), where `approvalDecimal` is state government approval as a 0-1 fraction and `officeStrength` varies by office type (Governor 1.0, House 0.9, Senate 0.8, State Senate 0.85). Centering on 0.5 approval keeps the multiplier from dominating the pool, the presidential path uses a steeper coefficient (0.5 instead of 0.2) for the same shape. Higher state approval means more votes allocated per turn; missing metrics default to 50% approval.
