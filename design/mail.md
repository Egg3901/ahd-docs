# Player Mail

In-game messaging between player characters. Players can send, receive, and report mail from character profile pages and the Notifications page.

## Sending Mail

- **Access**: Click "Send Mail" on any character's profile page, which opens the Mail Composer Modal
- **Fields**: Subject (max 80 chars), Body (max 1000 chars)
- **Formatting**: Markdown-lite support - `**bold**` and `*italic*` rendered via `renderMailBody()` in `src/lib/utils/renderMailBody.tsx`
- **Rate limit**: 1 message per minute per sender
- **Requirement**: Both sender and recipient must have characters

## Inbox & Sent Box

The Mail tab on the Notifications page (`/notifications`) provides two views:

- **Inbox**: All received mail, newest first. Unread messages highlighted. Expanding a message auto-marks it as read.
- **Sent**: All sent mail, newest first. Senders can delete their copy independently.

Both views are paginated via the API.

## Unread Count

Unread mail count is returned by both `/api/client-nav` and `/api/auth/me` as `unreadMailCount`. The navbar badge combines unread notifications + unread mail into a single count.

## Deletion

Mail uses **dual-sided soft-delete**:

- Recipient deletes → sets `deletedByRecipient: true`; mail disappears from their inbox but remains in sender's sent box
- Sender deletes → sets `deletedBySender: true`; mail disappears from their sent box but remains in recipient's inbox
- When both flags are true, the document can be hard-deleted (currently retained)

## Reporting

Any received message can be reported for abuse. Reports go to the admin mail reports queue.

- **Player action**: "Report" button on expanded inbox messages
- **Creates**: `PlayerMailReport` document with status `"pending"`
- **One report per mail**: Duplicate reports on the same message are rejected

## Admin Mail Reports

Admin > Support > Mail Reports tab. Filterable by status: pending, dismissed, actioned.

Each report shows the full message body, sender/recipient links, and four actions:

| Action      | Effect                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Dismiss** | Sets status to `"dismissed"`; no player impact               |
| **Delete**  | Removes the mail document; sets status to `"actioned"`       |
| **Warn**    | Sends a system notification to the sender; sets `"actioned"` |
| **Ban**     | Bans the sender's user account; sets `"actioned"`            |

All actions accept an optional admin note (max 500 chars).

## Shareholder Address

CEOs can broadcast a message to all current shareholders of their corporation.

- **Access**: Corporation page > CEO Office > Admin subtab
- **Cooldown**: 12 hours per corporation (enforced via `lastShareholderAddressAt` on the `Corporation` document)
- **Delivery**: Sent as system notifications (not mail) to each shareholder's userId
- **Composer**: Uses the same Mail Composer Modal in `shareholder-address` mode
