# Elections

## Overview

Elections run perpetually across five race types: House, Senate, Governor, State Senate, and President. Each election has a **primary phase** (intra-party competition) followed by a **general phase** (inter-party competition). One turn = one hour; timers advance each turn.

## Election Types

| Type             | Seats                | Scope                    | Notes                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **House**        | 435 total (by state) | Per state                | Multi-seat; proportional allocation |
| **Senate**       | 100 (2 per state)    | Per state, per class     | Single-seat; 3 staggered classes    |
| **Governor**     | 50 (1 per state)     | Per state                | Single-seat                         |
| **State Senate** | Varies               | Per state                | Multi-seat; proportional allocation |
| **President**    | 1 (national)         | National (`state: "US"`) | Electoral College; 270 to win       |

## Seat Identifiers

Each political seat has a stable `seatId` that persists across election cycles, enabling external systems (Discord bots, APIs) to reliably track races.

**Format**: `{countryId}-{electionType}-{localRegionId}[-{senateClass}]`

| Seat                        | seatId           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Pennsylvania Senate Class 1 | `US-senate-PA-1` |
| Pennsylvania House          | `US-house-PA`    |
| California Governor         | `US-governor-CA` |
| U.S. President              | `US-president`   |
| London Commons              | `UK-commons-LON` |
| Scotland Commons            | `UK-commons-SCO` |

**Historical race IDs** append the cycle number: `US-senate-PA-1-c3` (third cycle).

The `seats` collection stores permanent seat documents with display names. Elections reference seats via the `seatId` field. Source: `src/lib/seats/seatId.ts`, `src/lib/db/types/seat.ts`.

## Election Phases

### Primary Phase

- **Purpose**: Select party nominee(s) for each office
- **Entry**: Players and NPPs declare candidacy during primary phase (`primaryEndTime > now`)
- **Voting**: No vote accumulation; resolution uses a **primary score** (see below)
- **Result**: One candidate per party advances to general; losers marked `withdrawn`
- **Resolution**: When `primaryEndTime <= now`, `resolvePrimariesIfNeeded()` runs (inside `advanceElectionTimers`)

### General Phase

- **Purpose**: Select office holder(s) from party nominees
- **Voting**: Vote accumulation each turn via `accumulateGeneralElectionVotes()`
- **Result**: Winner(s) take office; `electedOfficials` updated; next cycle spawned
- **Resolution**: When `endTime <= now`, election marked `completed`; `resolveGeneralElections()` runs

## Duration by Race Type

48 hours = 1 year in game time.

| Type         | Total Duration      | Primary Duration | General Duration |
| ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| House        | 96 hours (2 years)  | 48 hours         | 48 hours         |
| Senate       | 288 hours (6 years) | 240 hours        | 48 hours         |
| Governor     | 192 hours (4 years) | 144 hours        | 48 hours         |
| State Senate | 192 hours (4 years) | 144 hours        | 48 hours         |
| President    | 192 hours (4 years) | 144 hours        | 48 hours         |

Senate classes staggered by 96 hours (2 years): Class 1 now, Class 2 +96h, Class 3 +192h.

Durations are configurable per election; new elections inherit from the most recently completed election for that slot. Source: `src/lib/turn/perpetualElections.ts` (`DEFAULT_DURATIONS`).

## Turn Processing Order

Election-related steps in `processTurn()` (`src/lib/turnSystem.ts`):

1. **NPP behavior**, NPPs cast speaker votes, bill votes, evaluate dropout, and enter elections (`processNPPTurn`)
2. Bill lifecycle
3. Campaign turn (income, actions, maintenance)
4. **Candidate party sweep**, withdraws stale candidacies after party switches
5. **Resolve primaries**, eliminates losers when `primaryEndTime` passes; must run before vote accumulation
6. **Accumulate general election votes**, one turn of votes for all active general-phase elections; **must run before timer advancement**
7. **Advance election timers**, marks elections "completed" when `endTime` passes
8. **Record primary snapshots**, for elections still in primary phase (trend data)
9. **Resolve completed general elections**, determines winners, updates `electedOfficials`, spawns next cycle
10. **Vacate leadership**, removes leadership from members who lost/changed office
11. **Ensure perpetual elections**, spawns missing elections for all race types
12. **Clean up stale candidates**, withdraws candidates still attached to completed elections

> **Critical ordering** (documented in `turnSystem.ts`): primaries resolve → votes accumulate → timers advance → elections resolve. Reordering would lose final-turn votes or include eliminated candidates in tallies.

## Primary Resolution

When `primaryEndTime` passes, `resolvePrimariesIfNeeded()` in `src/lib/turn/primaryResolution.ts`:

1. Finds elections with `primaryEndTime <= now` and `endTime > now`
2. For each party with multiple candidates, computes a **primary score** per candidate. The raw score is then multiplied by an **infamy penalty**, `1 − 0.05 × (infamy/100)`, for player characters (NPPs aren't affected).

   **State-level races** (House, Senate, Governor, State Senate):
   - **Alignment, state**: `25 − (|econ − stateEconLean| + |social − stateSocialLean|) × 1.25`, max 25 pts (when state cached lean is available)
   - **Alignment, party**: `15 − (|econ − partyEcon| + |social − partySocial|) × 0.75`, max 15 pts
   - **Favorability**: `(favorability / 100) × 35`, max 35 pts
   - **Political Influence**: `normalizeNPI(politicalInfluence) × 25`, max 25 pts (sqrt curve, capped at 1.0 once PI reaches 100)
   - **Fallback when state lean is missing**: alignment collapses to a single 40-pt party-only check (`max(0, 40 − (|econDiff_party| + |socialDiff_party|) × 2.0)`), preserving the pre-rework formula.

   **Presidential** (national, no state-position component):
   - **Alignment**: `40 − (|econ − partyEcon| + |social − partySocial|) × 2.0`, max 40 pts
   - **Party Influence** (candidate's accumulated party clout): `normalizePartyInfluencePresidentialPrimary(partyInfluence) × 20`, weight 20 (`PRESIDENT_PRIMARY_PARTY_INFLUENCE_WEIGHT`)
   - **National Influence**: `normalizeNationalReachPresidentialPrimary(nationalInfluence) × 15`, max 15 pts (linear-up-to-cap, NPI ≥ 100 saturates at 1.0)
   - **Favorability**: `(favorability / 100) × 25`, max 25 pts

3. Highest score per party advances; others marked `withdrawn`
4. Win/loss notifications sent to player candidates
5. General vote tally initialized (or created if missing)

## Vote Accumulation (General Phase)

Handled by `src/lib/electionEngine.ts` and `accumulateVoteTurn()`.

### Model

- **Total pool**: State turnout derived from demographics (category weights, group populations, default turnout)
- **Per-turn weight**: A **three-tier closing surge**, not a flat split (`turnVoteWeight()` in `src/lib/electionEngine/voteCalculations.ts`):
  - **Early band**: `EARLY_POOL_SHARE = 0.5` of the pool, spread over every turn before the ramp band
  - **Ramp band**: the `RAMP_TURNS = 8` turns before election day get `RAMP_POOL_SHARE = 0.2` of the pool
  - **Final band**: the last `ELECTION_DAY_TURNS = 4` turns get `FINAL_POOL_SHARE = 0.3` of the pool
  - Shares sum to 1. Very short races (`totalTurns <= 4`) spread the pool evenly instead.
- **Party strength**: The turn pool is scaled by `(1 + (approval − 0.5) × 0.2) × officeStrength` for state races, `(1 + (approval − 0.5) × 0.5) × officeStrength` for president (see below)
- **Distribution**: Each turn, the **effective** pool is distributed proportionally to each candidate's **vote potential**

### FPTP & RCV, Vote-Splitting System

The voting system used by each state determines whether the **vote-splitting (spoiler) effect** is applied after the group-level allocation.

#### First Past the Post (FPTP), Default

In FPTP states, third-party candidates create an explicit **spoiler effect**:

1. After group-level votes are distributed, for each third-party candidate in the race, **`FPTP_SPOILER_RATE` (4%) × the third party's own group-level allocation** is drawn from the ideologically nearest **major-party** candidate (per `getMajorPartiesForRegion(countryId, parentRegionId)`, e.g. Democrat/Republican in the US, Labour/Conservative in England, SNP/Labour in Scotland) and transferred to the third party.
2. "Nearest" is measured by Manhattan distance on the economic / social policy grid.
3. This models the real-world vote-splitting dynamic: a Green Party candidate on the left bleeds coalition voters from the Democratic candidate, potentially handing the race to the Republican.

**Political implications (design intent):**

- Major parties view nearby third parties as **existential threats**, a strong Green Party or Libertarian Party can flip a seat to the opposing major party.
- This creates a natural wedge between the major-party establishment and third-party movements.
- Third parties cannot easily win seats under FPTP even with significant support, they spoil the nearest major party's chances without securing victory themselves.
- This drives the third-party strategic goal: **advocate for states to adopt RCV**, where the spoiler dynamic disappears.

**Example (FPTP, Texas):**

| Candidate | Party      | Group-level votes | After FPTP spoiler   |
| --------- | ---------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| Adams     | Democrat   | 400,000           | 392,000 (−8,000)     |
| Brooks    | Republican | 450,000           | 450,000 (unaffected) |
| Chen      | Green      | 200,000           | 208,000 (+8,000)     |

_Green is ideologically near Democrat. 4% × 200,000 = 8,000 spoiled, drawn from Dem. Rep is unaffected._

The key outcome: Democrat loses 8,000 votes; Green gains 8,000, but Green still finishes second. Republican wins with the plurality. In a tighter race the 8,000-vote swing is enough to flip the seat.

#### Ranked Choice Voting (RCV), Optional (legislated per state)

In RCV states, **no vote-splitting adjustment is applied**. Third parties compete on equal footing with major parties:

- Voters can safely express a third-party first preference without harming their second-choice major-party candidate.
- A strong Green candidate in an RCV state does **not** bleed votes from the Democrat.
- Third parties can build genuine coalition support and grow their seat share without triggering the spoiler dynamic.
- States switch to RCV through legislation; switching back removes the advantage.

**Implementation:** `FPTP_SPOILER_RATE` is defined in `src/lib/electionEngine/constants.ts`. Major parties for the spoiler step come from `getMajorPartiesForRegion()` in `src/lib/constants/countries.ts`, the same helper used in `src/lib/electionEngine/voteDistribution.ts` and in-race poll math in `src/lib/actions/pollCalculations.ts` (invoked from `src/app/api/actions/poll/route.ts`). The voting system is stored per state in `states.votingSystem` (`"fptp"` | `"rcv"`, defaults to `"fptp"`).

### Total Appeal System (Pipeline)

**Two distribution paths exist.** Primaries and commissioned polls use the **group-level competitive allocation** model described below (each demographic group votes as a bloc, splitting its vote pool among candidates by relative appeal). General-election vote accumulation defaults to the **swing-flow model** (`distributeVotesBySwingFlow()` in `src/lib/electionEngine/voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`, set unconditionally in `tallyManagement.ts`); group-level allocation remains available as a fallback/legacy path for generals but is not the live default. See [Election Engine](./election-engine.md) for the swing-flow driver stack (coattails, median-voter, persuasion, party-tenure fatigue, incumbency). The appeal/reach/approval math below is the shared foundation both paths build on.

The full pipeline from candidate and state to votes per turn (shared with poll and NPP dropout via `src/lib/utils/demographicAppeal.ts`):

> **Stat used by race type:**
>
> - **State races** (House, Senate, Governor, State Senate): use **Political Influence** (`politicalInfluence`, capped 0-100)
> - **Presidential race**: use **National Political Influence** (`nationalInfluence`)

1. **Reach**, `normalizeNPI(influence)`: fraction of turned-out voters the candidate can reach. Sqrt curve, hard-capped at 1.0 once PI/NPI reaches 100. Both state and presidential general elections use this curve. (Presidential primary reach uses a separate linear-up-to-cap function.)
2. **Appeal (per demographic group)**, Position score `25 × (positionRaw/50)^1.5 + floor`, where `positionRaw = max(0, 50 − |econDiff|×5 − |socialDiff|×5)` and `APPEAL_POSITION_EXPONENT = 1.5` (`src/lib/utils/demographicAppeal.ts`), plus a directional (tribal-voter) bonus of up to `DIRECTION_BONUS_PER_AXIS = 5` per axis, plus `normalizeNPI(influence) × 12.5` when influence is included. Max 50 (position ~25 + influence ~25 at PI=100). Does NOT include favorability, that scales at the end. (γ=2, the legacy squared curve, is still supported as a special case but is not the live default.)
3. **Group-level competitive allocation**, Each demographic group contributes to the turn pool proportionally to its size. Within each group, candidates split that contribution by relative `(appeal × reach × approval × partyOrg × infamyMult)`. Groups vote as blocs; higher appeal with a group yields a larger share of that group's votes.
4. **Approval scalar**, `favorability / 100`: voters won't support candidates they don't approve of. 0% approval = 0 votes.
5. **Party org scalar**, General elections: `normalizedOrgShare ^ ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT` (`ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT = 0.2`), the party's normalized share of statewide Org among all parties, with diminishing returns; no Org data anywhere falls back to a neutral 1×. Primaries use a uniform neutral 1× (intra-party Org cancels). This retired the older flat `0.5 + (org/100)×0.5` scalar (2026-06-18).
6. **Infamy scalar**, `1 − 0.05 × (infamy/100)`: player characters lose up to 5% of their per-group weight at infamy=100. NPPs leave infamy unset and are unaffected.
7. **Party strength modifier**, `(1 + (approvalDecimal − 0.5) × 0.2) × officeStrength` for state races (`× 0.5` in place of `× 0.2` for president, so presidential races feel state approval 2.5x more strongly):
   - **State government approval**: 0-100% from state metrics vs. national averages (see [Government Approval](./government-approval.md)). When metrics are missing, 50% is used. At 50% approval the modifier is 1.0x baseline regardless of office; state races swing ±10% (0% approval → 0.9x, 100% → 1.1x) before the office-strength factor, president swings ±25% (0.75x-1.25x).
   - **Office strength**: Governor 1.0, House 0.9, Senate 0.8, State Senate 0.85.
8. **Effective turn pool**, Base turn pool × party strength modifier. Same modifier for all candidates in that election; relative shares are unchanged.
9. **Distribution**, For each group, its share of the effective turn pool is split among candidates by relative (appeal × reach × approval × partyOrg × infamyMult). Votes per candidate are summed across all groups.

### Factors Affecting Votes

| Factor                                 | Effect                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Policy alignment**                   | Power curve, exponent 1.5: `25 × (positionRaw/50)^1.5 + floor`, `positionRaw = 50 − econDiff×5 − socialDiff×5`; closer = higher appeal            |
| **Political influence (PI)**           | State races only, reach + appeal score. Capped 0-100; max reach = 1.0                                                                            |
| **National Political Influence (NPI)** | Presidential race only, sqrt scaling via `normalizeNPI`, hard-capped at 1.0 once NPI reaches 100. Above 100 it saturates (no celebrity bonus).   |
| **Favorability (approval)**            | Final scalar: `(favorability/100)^0.8` (`APPROVAL_SCALAR_EXPONENT`); 0% approval = 0 votes                                                        |
| **Party org**                          | Final scalar in general elections: `normalizedOrgShare ^ 0.2` (`ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT`), a party's normalized share of statewide Org with diminishing returns. Primaries use a uniform neutral 1×. |
| **Government approval**                | Scales the turn pool by (1 + approval); high-approval states allocate more votes per turn                                                         |
| **Office strength**                    | Governor 1.0, House 0.9, Senate 0.8, State Senate 0.85, governor races most affected by approval                                                 |
| **Voting system (FPTP/RCV)**           | FPTP: third-party candidates gain `FPTP_SPOILER_RATE` × their own allocation drawn from nearest major party (spoiler effect). RCV: no adjustment. |

Campaign actions raise favorability and influence; ads raise recognition and favorability.

## Polls vs simulated votes

**State and general elections (House, Senate, Governor, State Senate, Commons, etc.):** Commissioned polls use the **group-level competitive allocation** and **FPTP spoiler** rules, including **region-aware major parties** and **per-archetype effective favorability** for opponents when that data exists (`src/lib/actions/pollCalculations.ts`, `src/lib/actions/electionOpponents.ts`). Turn-by-turn general-election vote accumulation itself defaults to the **swing-flow model** instead (see above); polls are an appeal-based projection and do not replay the swing-flow driver stack.

**Presidential:** Simulated votes are accumulated **per electoral unit** in `src/lib/presidentialElectionEngine.ts` (averaged party vs character positions, national influence for reach, influence included in appeal, state/district lean, independent penalty, swing-state ground game). The **FPTP spoiler step is applied at half rate** (`PRESIDENTIAL_SPOILER_RATE = 2%`) on the presidential distribution path to prevent fragmented fields from producing EC landslides via winner-take-all. Player polls remain **home-state** projections and do **not** replicate the national presidential model, treat poll topline and in-race breakdowns as **indicative for the character’s state**, not as an Electoral College forecast.

## Multi-Seat Races (House, State Senate)

- **House**: Real seat distribution (e.g., CA 52, TX 38). See `HOUSE_SEATS` in `src/lib/turn/electionResolution.ts`
- **Proportional allocation**: Largest-remainder method
- **Minimum share**: 20% of votes to be eligible for seats (`MULTI_SEAT_MIN_SHARE`). **Exception**: State Senate and Regional Council use 10% to allow smaller parties to win seats in larger districts.
- **2-seat House special case**: Winner takes both seats unless at least one opponent reaches the minimum share threshold (20% for House, 10% for State Senate)
- **Seats estimate**: Updated each vote turn; `voteFraction × totalSeats` per candidate

## Senate Elections

- **Staggered classes**: Class 1, 2, 3, each state has 2 senators in different classes
- **Elections**: One seat per class per state; single-winner
- **Continuity**: Senate slots spawn only if that class was previously initialized (admin or prior election)

## Governor Elections

- **Scope**: One governor per state; single-seat, single-winner (like Senate).
- **Duration**: 192 hours total (4 years), 48 hours primary; configurable per election.
- **Continuity**: Governor elections run perpetually. When a state has no active or upcoming governor race, a new one is spawned. **Bootstrap**: If no state has ever completed a governor election, one governor election is spawned per state so the first cycle exists; thereafter, replacement is spawned only after the previous governor election for that state completes.
- **Vote accumulation**: Uses the same appeal and party-strength rules as above, with office strength 1.0 (governor races are most affected by state government approval).

## Candidacy Rules

- **One office at a time**: Players can only run for one office per election cycle
- **Home state only**: `homeState === election.state`; out-of-state returns 403. **Exception**: President (`state: "US"`), any state.
- **Party**: Characters run under their current party affiliation. Independents can run in the "independent" party primary, no penalty at entry, but general-election vote penalties apply (see [Presidential](#presidential-election)).
- **Declaration**: Must declare during primary phase (`primaryEndTime > now`). Independents run in the "independent" party primary like any other party, no general-phase exception.
- **House/State Senate**: Candidates may request multiple seats (`seatsRequested`)
- **Country restriction**: `character.countryId === election.countryId`; cross-country entry returns 403

## Election Entry API

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/elections/[id]/enter`

**Validation:**

```typescript
// src/app/api/elections/[id]/enter/route.ts

// 1. Election must be upcoming or active
if (election.status !== "upcoming" && election.status !== "active") {
  return 400; // "This election is not open for entry"
}

// 2. Primary deadline enforced
if (primaryEnded) {
  return 400; // "The primary entry period has ended"
}

// 3. Country restriction
if (electionCountry !== characterCountry) {
  return 403; // "This election is for {X} characters only"
}

// 4. Home state restriction (president is national)
if (!isPresident && election.state !== character.homeState) {
  return 403; // "You can only run for office in your home state"
}

// 5. One race at a time check
const blocking = await findBlockingActiveCandidacy(db, character._id, electionObjectId);
if (blocking) {
  return 400; // "You are already running in {race}"
}
```

**Party switching:** If already entered under a different party, the old candidacy is auto-withdrawn before creating the new one.

**Achievement trigger:** Election entry triggers achievement checks via `checkElectionEntryAchievements()`.

## Withdrawal Mechanics

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/elections/[id]/withdraw`

**Effects:**

```typescript
// src/app/api/elections/[id]/withdraw/route.ts

// 1. Mark candidate as withdrawn
await db
  .collection("electionCandidates")
  .updateOne({ _id: candidate._id }, { $set: { status: "withdrawn", withdrawnAt: now } });

// 2. Remove votes from tally
await removeWithdrawnCandidateFromTally(db, electionObjectId, candidate._id.toString());

// 3. Delete campaign document
await db.collection("campaigns").deleteOne({
  electionId: electionObjectId,
  candidateId: candidate.characterId,
});
```

**Restrictions:**

- Cannot withdraw from completed, resolved, or cancelled elections
- Withdrawn candidates cannot re-enter the same election
- Votes are permanently removed from the tally (not redistributed)

## Election Continuity

All race types run perpetually:

- **House**: Next cycle spawned immediately when previous resolves (`spawnHouseElection`)
- **Senate / Governor / State Senate**: `ensurePerpetualElections()` runs each turn; spawns replacement for any slot with no active or upcoming race
- **Governor bootstrap**: If no state has any completed governor election yet, one governor election is spawned per state so every state has an initial governor race; after that, governor is spawned only when that state's previous governor election has completed
- **President**: Spawned via canonical LARP schedule when no active/upcoming president election exists. Anchored to real-world presidential election years (2020, 2024, 2028…). The `isPresidentialElectionYear(turn)` guard was removed, the canonical cycle window together with the 24h-primary / 24h-general gate ensures president only spawns in valid windows.
- New elections use canonical `DEFAULT_DURATIONS` from `src/lib/constants/electionDurations.ts`, not the prior cycle's durations. Admin timer edits do not drag the LARP calendar.
- Cycle counter increments on each spawned election
- **Admin**: "Spawn Missing Elections" in Admin → Elections → Manage triggers immediate continuity check

## Polling & Display

- **No WebSocket**: Client-side polling on page load and after actions (see [Technical Architecture](./technical-architecture.md))
- **Primary snapshots**: Recorded each turn for elections in primary phase; used for trend graphs
- **General tally**: `electionVoteTallies` stores `totalVotes`, `turnSnapshots`, `sharesPct`, `seatsEstimate`
- **API**: `GET /api/elections`, `GET /api/elections/[id]` return polling data and candidate lists

## Presidential Election

- **Scope**: National (`electionType: "president"`, `state: "US"`). Any state can run; no home-state check.
- **Influence stat**: Uses **NPI** (`nationalInfluence`) exclusively, not `politicalInfluence`. NPI grows passively each turn (+state influence ÷ 100). Reach uses a sqrt curve hard-capped at 1.0 once NPI reaches 100; presidential primary scoring uses a separate linear-up-to-cap function on the same value.
- **Primaries**: One national primary per party; national appeal score (population-weighted state blend). Independents skip primary; enter during general phase only.
- **General**: Per-state (and ME/NE district) vote accumulation; Electoral College resolution. 538 total EV; 270 to win.
- **Electoral College**: `ELECTORAL_VOTE_UNITS` in `src/lib/constants/states.ts`. ME and NE split by congressional district (ME: 2 at-large + CD1 + CD2; NE: 2 at-large + CD1 + CD2 + CD3). District lean proxies applied for ME/NE (see `UNIT_LEAN`).
- **Independent penalty**: 0.3× vote share in general (70% reduction).
- **Running mate (VP)**: After primary, each nominee selects a running mate. VP cannot be current President. Stored on `ElectionCandidate.runningMateId`.

**API:** `POST /api/elections/[id]/running-mate`

```typescript
// src/app/api/elections/[id]/running-mate/route.ts

// Validation:
// - Only the candidate can set their own running mate
// - Running mate cannot be the current President
// - Running mate cannot be the same person (self-selection)
// - Accepts character ObjectId or "" to clear

await db
  .collection<ElectionCandidate>("electionCandidates")
  .updateOne(
    { _id: myCandidate._id },
    { $set: { runningMateId: runningMateObjectId, updatedAt: new Date() } }
  );
```

- **Timing**: Spawned via canonical LARP schedule when no active/upcoming president election exists. Anchored to real-world presidential election years (2024, 2028, 2032 under the 2019-default preset; 1992, 1996, 2000… under the 1991-default preset). 48 turns = 1 year. `pickNextCanonicalCycle()` in `src/lib/elections/canonicalCycle.ts` returns the next cycle whose remaining primary AND general windows clear the 24h+24h floor at `currentTurn`; the legacy `isPresidentialElectionYear()` guard has been removed.
- **Tie-breaker**: 269-269 EV tie resolved by deterministic coin flip (election ID + candidate IDs).
- **Vote accumulation**: `accumulatePresidentVoteTurn()` in `src/lib/presidentialElectionEngine.ts`; resolution in `electionResolution.ts`.
- **Vote-flow model**: Presidential general votes are distributed by `distributeVotesBySwingFlow()` in `src/lib/electionEngine/voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`, the only model the presidential engine calls; there is no legacy/alternate path selectable at runtime.
- **Presidential vote weights**: Appeal position averages **candidate and party** via `partyPositionWeight` (`= 1/3` in `presidentialElectionEngine.ts`): `pos = (pw × party + candidate) / (pw + 1)` = `(party + 3×candidate) / 4`, roughly **75% candidate position, 25% party position**, so the candidate's own stance dominates. **State lean** applies a small tiebreaker multiplier on top of appeal (`leanVoteMultiplier()`): `1 + lean × sign × STATE_LEAN_STRENGTH`, with `STATE_LEAN_STRENGTH = 0.1` for states (`0.3` for ME/NE congressional districts), clamped to `[0.8, 1.2]`, at most a 1.5:1 swing. Lean is already priced into appeal via the swing-flow substrate; this multiplier is a demoted tiebreaker, not the primary driver.
- **Electoral map**: Presidential election detail shows `PresidentialElectoralMap` with per-unit EV allocation, state-level vote totals in tooltips, and EV lead summary.

## NPP Election Participation

See [NPP System](./npp-system.md) for full documentation. NPPs autonomously enter and drop out of elections each turn via `processElectionEntry()` in `src/lib/turn/npp/electionEntry.ts`.

### Entry

- **Eligibility**: Not retired, not on cooldown for that election, not already in an active race
- **Scope**: Home state for all regional races (House, Senate, Governor, State Senate, Commons, Shugiin, Sangiin, Regional Council, Bundestag). **NPPs are barred from presidential races**, players always have the opportunity to contest the presidency without NPP auto-entry distorting the field.
- **Types**: All race types except president
- **Timing**: Only during primary phase (`primaryEndTime > now`)
- **Priority order** (highest to lowest): State Senate → Regional Council → Sangiin → House → Senate → Shugiin → Governor → President → Commons
- **One NPP per party per primary**: Each primary gets exactly one NPP candidate per party to avoid splitting the party vote
- **Two-pass system**: Incumbents get first priority to defend their seats; non-incumbents fill remaining slots by party/state priority. Deterministic, no random chance.

### Dropout / Elimination

- NPPs are eliminated during **primary resolution** (same as player candidates) when their primary score is not the highest in their party
- Eliminated NPPs are marked `withdrawn` and receive a per-election cooldown; they cannot re-enter until `primaryEndTime` passes
- There is no separate "appeal-based" dropout pass, NPPs compete on the same primary score formula as players

### Spawn (Admin)

Admin → Elections → NPP Management: spawn 1-500 NPPs per party with weighting (`lean` / `members` / `both`).

## Presidential Travel

During the general election phase, presidential candidates can travel to specific states to campaign in person.

- **Cost**: `getTravelActionCost()` scales with the target state's electoral votes: EV ≤ 5 → 3 actions, EV ≤ 10 → 5, EV ≤ 20 → 7, EV > 20 → 10 (small states are cheap, big states are expensive)
- **Effect**: Traveling to a state is a gate, not a passive bonus. It is the eligibility requirement for the character's canvassing actions in that state; there is no automatic per-turn favorability gain from travel alone
- **Visibility**: Travel state shown on the electoral map as a badge
- **Strategy**: Lets candidates focus campaign presence (canvassing) in swing states
- **Restrictions**: Only active presidential candidates can travel; one state at a time

**API:** `POST /api/elections/[id]/travel`

```typescript
// src/app/api/elections/[id]/travel/route.ts

const actionCost = getTravelActionCost(stateId, gameState?.preset);

// Validates:
// - Election is presidential and active
// - User is an active candidate
// - Has enough actions (cost varies by state EV)
// - State is a valid US state

await db
  .collection<ElectionCandidate>("electionCandidates")
  .updateOne({ _id: candidate._id }, { $set: { travelState: stateId, traveledAt: now } });
```

Travel is a presidential-only mechanic. State-level races use standard campaign/ads actions instead.

## Campaign Strategy

### Building Support

- **Campaign**: Raises **Political Influence** (up to +1% per action, diminishing returns above 50% PI), name recognition / reach. Cost scales with current PI and state GDP per capita.
- **Advertise**: Raises **Favorability** (+1-3 per action, diminishing returns above 70%). Cost scales with current favorability and state GDP.
- **Build Donor Network**: Increases donor base level (unlocks higher fundraising yields). One-time unlock; L0→L75 costs ~₳4.4M at national-average GDP.
- **Fundraise**: Converts donor base level into campaign funds. ₳50K floor + ₳2K per donor level, scaled by state PI.
- Policy alignment with demographics affects vote calculations
- Endorsements provide stat boosts

### Attack Strategy

- **Attack** (influence action): Reduces target Favorability by 1, costs 2 Infamy to attacker
- **Action-point cost**: `BASE_INFLUENCE_COST = 6` action points per support/attack action (`src/lib/influence/simpleInfluence.ts`), raised from a legacy 2 AP specifically so a favorability strike competes with campaigning, fundraising and political operations for a player's turn instead of being nearly free.
- **Per-turn cap**: `MAX_NET_FAVORABILITY_SWING_PER_TURN = 12`, the net favorability change any one target can absorb from player support/attack actions in a single turn, in either direction. This is a backstop against extreme coordinated pile-ons, not the primary limiter (the AP cost is); it sits well above normal single-turn swings.
- **Failure chance**: Attacks can fail based on attacker's Infamy (`failureChance = infamy × 10`). Failed attacks still cost 2 Infamy.
- **Infamy drain**: Infamy > 20% causes passive Favorability drain each turn (`(infamy − 20) × 0.05%`)
- **Cross-state cost**: Attacking out-of-state targets costs more action points (base 2, scaled by state adjacency)

### Geographic Strategy

- Campaign costs scale with state GDP per capita
- Out-of-state campaigning costs more
- Different states have different demographic compositions

## Vote Accumulation Pipeline

Each turn, `accumulateVoteTurn()` in `tallyManagement.ts` runs the following pipeline:

1. **Fetch tally + candidates**, Load `ElectionVoteTally` and active `ElectionCandidate` records
2. **Load state context**, State demographics, categories, party orgs, turnout modifiers
3. **Resolve effective turnout**, `resolveTurnout()` combines baseline turnout with GOTV/canvassing/suppression modifiers
4. **Compute turn pool**, `turnVoteWeight()` allocates the pool in a three-tier closing surge: 50% early, 20% in the 8-turn ramp band, 30% in the final 4 turns
5. **Apply party strength**, State government approval × office strength scales the pool
6. **Enrich candidates**, `fetchEnrichedCandidates()` merges character/NPP stats (policies, favorability, influence, archetype approvals)
7. **Distribute votes**, general elections call `distributeVotesBySwingFlow()` (default); primaries call `distributeVotesByGroupLevelAllocation()`:
   - For each demographic group: compute appeal, reach, approval, partyOrg
   - Split group's share of pool proportionally by candidate weights
   - Apply FPTP spoiler effect (if general election in FPTP state): transfer `FPTP_SPOILER_RATE × thirdPartyVotes` from nearest major party
   - Swing-flow additionally layers coattails, median-voter, persuasion, and incumbency drivers, see [Election Engine](./election-engine.md)
8. **Update tally**, Accumulate votes, update shares, compute seat estimates for multi-seat races
9. **Snapshot**, Push turn snapshot to `turnSnapshots` array for trend tracking

### FPTP Spoiler Effect

In FPTP states (default), third-party candidates create a spoiler effect:

```typescript
// From voteDistribution.ts:145-166
for (const tp of thirdParties) {
  const spoiled = votesPerCandidate[tp.candidateId] * FPTP_SPOILER_RATE; // 4% of third-party votes
  // Find ideologically nearest major party (Manhattan distance on EP/SP grid)
  let nearest = majorParties.findClosest(tp.charEP, tp.charSP);
  votesPerCandidate[nearest.candidateId] -= spoiled;
  votesPerCandidate[tp.candidateId] += spoiled;
}
```

This models real-world vote-splitting: a Green Party candidate bleeds Democratic votes; a Libertarian bleeds Republican votes. RCV states skip this step entirely.

### Presidential Electoral College

Presidential elections use `computeElectoralVotes()` in `electoralVoteService.ts`:

- **538 total EVs**, 270 to win
- **Per-unit accumulation**, Each electoral unit (state + ME/NE districts) tracks votes separately
- **Winner-take-all**, Unit winner gets all EVs (ME/NE split by district)
- **Tie-breaker**, Deterministic coin flip using election ID + candidate IDs
- **EV-by-turn tracking**, `unitTurnSnapshots` stores per-turn EV allocation for trend graphs

## Elections Hub

The `/elections` page is the central listing of all elections across all race types and states.

- **Active Only toggle**: Filters the list to show only elections currently in primary or general voting phase (hides upcoming races not yet open for candidacy)
- **Default state**: All elections shown
- **Compact campaign cards**: Each candidate entry links to their dedicated campaign page (`/campaign/[id]`)

## County & Congressional District Maps

State-level results for presidential, governor, and senate elections can be explored at `/elections/[id]/state/[stateId]`.

### County Maps

- **Visualization**: Interactive SVG map showing county-level vote distribution
- **Data**: 3,142 US counties (and county-equivalents) with real population and partisan lean data
- **Hover**: Tooltips showing candidate vote breakdown, margin, and partisan lean per county
- **Algorithm**: Vote distribution is derived from county partisan lean and population; more partisan counties vote more heavily for aligned candidates

### Congressional District Maps

- **Visualization**: Shows House seat allocation by congressional district for that state
- **Data**: Real congressional district boundaries and seat counts
- **API**:
  - `GET /api/elections/[id]/state/[stateId]/county-results`, county vote distribution
  - `GET /api/elections/[id]/state/[stateId]/cd-results`, district seat assignments
