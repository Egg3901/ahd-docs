# Election Engine

## Overview

The Election Engine is the core vote calculation and tally management system for all elections in A House Divided. It handles vote distribution across demographic groups, vote accumulation over time, and election resolution.

**Location:** `src/lib/electionEngine/`

**Key files:**

- `voteDistribution.ts` - Group-level competitive vote allocation (primaries; general-election fallback)
- `voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts` - Two-phase pairwise swing-flow allocation (default for general elections, §7.3.2)
- `tallyManagement.ts` - Vote accumulation and tally initialization
- `voteCalculations.ts` - Turn vote weight calculations (three-tier closing surge)
- `resolvedTurnout.ts` - Dynamic turnout resolution with GOTV/canvassing modifiers
- `candidateEnrichment.ts` - Candidate data enrichment with appeal calculations
- `constants.ts` - Tunable parameters (spoiler rate, NPP weight)

## Vote Distribution Model

### Philosophy

**Two distribution paths exist.** Primaries always use the **group-level competitive allocation** model in `voteDistribution.ts` (each demographic group votes as a bloc, splitting its vote pool among candidates by relative appeal). General elections default to the **swing-flow model** in `voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts` (`tallyManagement.ts` sets `useSwingFlowModel = true` unconditionally for general elections); `distributeVotesByGroupLevelAllocation` remains available as a fallback/legacy path but is not the general-election default. The sections below describe the group-level model, which still governs primaries and is the basis the swing-flow model was built on top of.

**Key principles:**

1. Groups vote as blocs (not individual voters)
2. Candidates split each group's vote by relative appeal
3. Appeal is multi-factor: position alignment + directional bonus + reach (influence)
4. Turnout is dynamic per group (GOTV and canvassing modifiers)

### Vote Distribution Formula

```typescript
for each demographic group:
  groupContribution = statePopulation × (populationPct/100) × (turnoutPct/100) × (categoryWeight/100)
  groupShare = groupContribution / totalPool
  groupPool = effectiveTurnPool × groupShare

  for each candidate:
    appeal = calcAppeal(demoEP, demoSP, charEP, charSP, influence, includeInfluence)
    reach = normalizeNPI(politicalInfluence or nationalInfluence)
    approval = approvalScalar(effectiveFavorability)
    org = isGeneralElection ? orgVoteWeight(partyOrgByParty, party) : 1

    weight = appeal × reach × approval × org × nppPenalty

  candidate's group votes = groupPool × (candidate's weight / total weight)
```

### Appeal Calculation

The appeal function (`calcAppeal()` in `src/lib/utils/demographicAppeal.ts`) calculates how well a candidate resonates with a demographic group. It is not a Gaussian falloff; it is a capped-linear position score plus a directional (tribal-voter) bonus, plus an optional influence term:

```typescript
positionRaw = max(0, 50 - |demoEP - charEP| × 5 - |demoSP - charSP| × 5)
// APPEAL_POSITION_EXPONENT = 1.5 is the live default (softened from the legacy
// squared curve, γ=2, which is still supported as a special case but not used).
// Endpoint-matched for any γ: positionRaw=0 → 0, positionRaw=50 → 25.
positionScore = 25 × (positionRaw / 50) ^ 1.5 + APPEAL_POSITION_FLOOR  // floor keeps appeal > 0

directionBonus = DIRECTION_BONUS_PER_AXIS × (directionFactor(EP) + directionFactor(SP))
// directionFactor rewards a candidate leaning the same way as the group's lean,
// ramping from a small center credit to full credit; suppressed to 0 if the
// candidate's lean conflicts in sign with their own party's position (party gate)

influenceScore = includeInfluenceInAppeal ? normalizeNPI(politicalInfluence) × 12.5 : 0
// state races: includeInfluenceInAppeal = false (influence is reach only)
// presidential races: includeInfluenceInAppeal = true (adds up to 25 pts)

appeal = positionScore + directionBonus + influenceScore   // capped at MAX_APPEAL
```

`useAveragedPositions` is a swing-flow-only option (`voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`); the group-level allocation path (`voteDistribution.ts`) does not blend candidate and party positions.

### Effective Favorability

Candidates receive approval bonuses based on archetype alignment:

```typescript
effectiveFav = clamp(favorability + (archetypeApproval × 0.5), 0, 100)  // calcEffectiveFavorability()
approvalScalar = clamp(effectiveFav / 100, 0, 1) ^ APPROVAL_SCALAR_EXPONENT  // APPROVAL_SCALAR_EXPONENT = 0.8, "If voters don't approve of you they won't vote for you."
```

### Party Organization Weight

**The old `partyOrgScalar` (1.0-1.6x standard, 1.0-2.5x presidential) was retired 2026-06-18.** General elections and polls now use `orgVoteWeight()` (`src/lib/electionEngine/electionFormulaFactors.ts`): a party's normalized share of statewide Org, raised to a sub-1 exponent for diminishing returns. Primaries use a uniform neutral `1×` (intra-party Org cancels out).

```typescript
// General elections
normalizedOrgShare = max(0, ownPartyOrg) / sum(max(0, orgByParty) for all parties)
orgVoteWeight = normalizedOrgShare ** ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT  // ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT = 0.2, diminishing returns
// No Org data anywhere → neutral fallback of 1

// Primaries
org = 1  // uniform; intra-party Org cancels
```

### NPP Weight Penalty

In general elections with human players, NPPs receive a weight penalty to reduce their structural advantage:

```typescript
nppPenalty = isNPP && hasPlayerInRace ? NPP_GENERAL_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER : 1;
// NPP_GENERAL_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 0.8 (20% penalty), src/lib/electionEngine/constants.ts
```

**Note:** This penalty applies only in general elections. Primaries use score-based handicapping instead.

## Spoiler Effect (FPTP Only)

In First-Past-The-Post systems, third-party candidates cause vote-splitting:

```typescript
if (isGeneralElection && votingSystem !== "rcv" && !isOnePartyState):
  for each third-party candidate:
    spoiled = thirdPartyVotes × FPTP_SPOILER_RATE  // × localOrgFactor if useOrgAwareSpoiler
    nearestMajorParty = findNearestMajorParty(thirdParty)
    transfer min(spoiled, nearestMajorPartyVotes) from nearest to thirdParty
```

**Constants** (`src/lib/electionEngine/constants.ts`):

- `FPTP_SPOILER_RATE = 0.04` (4% of a third-party candidate's own group-level allocation is drawn from the nearest major party)
- `PRESIDENTIAL_SPOILER_RATE = 0.02` (half the state-level rate; applied only when passed explicitly via `spoilerRate`)
- Distance metric: `|EP_diff| + |SP_diff|` (Manhattan)

**Exemptions:** RCV elections skip the spoiler step entirely. One-party states also skip it. The regime multiplier already encodes ruling-vs-approved dominance by an order of magnitude, and "third party bleeds the major" doesn't describe that regime type.

## Turn Vote Accumulation

Elections accumulate votes over multiple turns. `voteCalculations.ts` no longer uses a bell curve; it uses a **three-tier closing surge** (`turnVoteWeight()`), turn-first and drift-immune when the election carries numeric `startTurn`/`endTurn` (falls back to a date-based window for legacy docs without turn fields):

```typescript
ELECTION_DAY_TURNS = 4  // sharp final-day spike band
RAMP_TURNS = 8          // gentle build-up band before it
EARLY_POOL_SHARE = 0.5
RAMP_POOL_SHARE = 0.2
FINAL_POOL_SHARE = 0.3  // shares must sum to 1

finalCount = ELECTION_DAY_TURNS
rampCount = min(RAMP_TURNS, totalTurns - finalCount)
earlyCount = totalTurns - finalCount - rampCount

turnVotes =
  turnIndex in final band ? FINAL_POOL_SHARE × totalPool / finalCount :
  turnIndex in ramp band  ? RAMP_POOL_SHARE × totalPool / rampCount :
  /* early band */          EARLY_POOL_SHARE × totalPool / earlyCount
```

This front-loads half the pool into the early turns, then spikes to 30% of the pool in the last 4 turns: the opposite shape of a bell curve. Very short races (`totalTurns <= ELECTION_DAY_TURNS`) spread the pool evenly instead. The `totalTurns`/`turnIndex` window passed in must start at the general-election start (`primaryEndTurn`), not the overall election `startTurn`, or the final-turn share balloons (ticket #955).

### Dynamic Turnout Resolution

Turnout is no longer static. The `resolveTurnout()` function combines static demographics with dynamic modifiers stored on a single `StateDemographicTurnout` document per region:

```typescript
for each demographic group:
  baselineTurnout = layer1Derived[groupId]        // US Layer-1 states: recomputed from race/age/education/wealth/ideology baselines + modifiers
                     ?? stateGroup.turnout          // stored archetype turnout
                     ?? group.defaultTurnout ?? 55

  // Sum modifiers across all category buckets in turnoutDoc.modifiers (groupId-keyed)
  modifier = sum(turnoutDoc.modifiers[category][groupId] for each category)

  finalTurnout = clamp(baselineTurnout + modifier, minTurnout, maxTurnout)  // default clamp 0-100
  groupContribution = population × (finalTurnout/100) × (categoryWeight/totalCategoryWeight)
```

**Data source:** `StateDemographicTurnout` (`src/lib/db/types/stateDemographicTurnout.ts`) stores one unified `modifiers: Record<categoryId, Record<groupId, number>>` map (percentage-point adjustments, ranged roughly -20 to +20, decaying 2%/turn), fed by party GOTV spending and player canvassing actions. There is no separate suppression field. `gotvEfforts`, `canvassingData`, and `suppressionData` do not exist in the codebase.

## Tally Management

### Initialization

When an election starts, a blank tally is created:

```typescript
{
  electionId: ObjectId,
  state: string,
  totalVotes: { candidateId: 0, ... },
  candidateNames: { candidateId: "Name", ... },
  candidateParties: { candidateId: "Party", ... },
  turnSnapshots: [],
  primaryResults?: PrimaryResults,
  finalized: false
}
```

### Per-Turn Accumulation

Each turn, `accumulateVoteTurn()` is called:

1. Fetch tally, active candidates, election metadata
2. Load state demographics, categories, party orgs, turnout doc
3. Resolve dynamic turnout with modifiers
4. Calculate turn vote weight (three-tier closing surge)
5. Apply party strength multiplier (approval × office strength)
6. Enrich candidates with appeal data
7. Distribute votes (swing-flow model for generals; group-level allocation for primaries)
8. Add new votes to cumulative totals
9. Calculate seat estimates for multi-seat races
10. Snapshot the turn's results

### Seat Estimation (Multi-Seat Races)

For multi-seat races, the system (`getMultiSeatMinShare()` in `src/lib/turn/election/seatAllocation.ts`) projects seat allocations using the Hamilton method (largest remainder), grouping votes by party (independents grouped individually):

```typescript
1. Filter candidate/party groups meeting minimum vote share threshold (see below)

2. Calculate exact seats: exactSeats = (groupVotes / poolVotes) × totalSeats

3. Give everyone floor(exactSeats)

4. Distribute remaining seats by largest remainder
```

**Minimum share thresholds** (flat gates, not `1/totalSeats`):

- Default (US House, most legislatures): 20%
- Lower-threshold chambers (State Senate, UK Regional Council, DE Landtag, CN People's Congress, IE Dáil/Seanad/Local Council, large-magnitude PR chambers FR/IT/ES/SE/TR/AT/FI/GR, DD Volkskammer): 10%
- UK Commons/snap-Commons with the historical majoritarian bonus active: 10% (down from the default 20%, so third parties survive the duopoly squeeze)

## Candidate Enrichment

The `fetchEnrichedCandidates()` function enhances candidate records with calculated data:

```typescript
EnrichedCandidate {
  candidateId: string,
  party: string,
  isNPP: boolean,
  favorability: number,
  politicalInfluence: number,
  nationalInfluence: number,
  charEP: number,       // Candidate economic position
  charSP: number,       // Candidate social position
  partyEcon?: number,   // Party economic position
  partySocial?: number, // Party social position
  archetypeApprovals: { [groupId]: number }
}
```

**Data sources:**

- `characters` or `npps` collection (based on `isNPP`)
- `politicalParties` for party positions
- `archetypeApprovals` from pre-calculated demographic alignment

## Constants and Tunables

All defined in `src/lib/electionEngine/constants.ts` unless noted.

| Constant                        | Value | Purpose                                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FPTP_SPOILER_RATE`              | 0.04  | Fraction of a third party's own group allocation spoiled from the nearest major party    |
| `PRESIDENTIAL_SPOILER_RATE`      | 0.02  | Spoiler rate for presidential elections (half the state rate)                            |
| `NPP_GENERAL_WEIGHT_MULTIPLIER`  | 0.8   | NPP penalty in general elections with a player in the race                               |
| `NPP_PRIMARY_SCORE_MULTIPLIER`   | 0.5   | NPP score penalty in primaries with a player in the same primary                         |
| `ORG_WEIGHT_EXPONENT`            | 0.2   | Diminishing-returns exponent on normalized Org share (`electionFormulaFactors.ts`)        |

`MONETARY_LAG_TURNS` (12) is not an election-engine constant. It lives in `src/lib/budget/inflation.ts` and governs interest-rate change lag, unrelated to elections.

## Integration Points

### Turn Processing

Election vote accumulation runs in the **`electionResolutionAndGovernment`** phase of the turn-phase registry, which comments call "Group 7". It is strictly sequential, since reordering steps corrupts elections (drops final-turn votes, or resolves offices from stale tallies):

```typescript
// src/simulation/phases/turnPhaseRegistry.ts
// electionResolutionAndGovernment phase (sequential sub-phases):
1. candidatePartySweep    - sweepPartyMismatchedCandidates()
2. primaryResolution      - resolvePrimariesIfNeeded()
3. voteAccumulation       - accumulateGeneralElectionVotes() (calls accumulateVoteTurn() per election)
4. campaignSpendReset     - processCampaignSpendReset() (after vote tallies read Campaign.spendThisTurn)
5. electionTimers         - advanceElectionTimers()
6. primarySnapshots       - recordPrimarySnapshots()
7. electionResolution     - resolveGeneralElections()
8. clearResolvedSupport   - processClearResolvedSupport()
9. leadershipVacate       - vacateLeadershipAfterElections() (only if generals resolved this turn)
```

`resolvePrimariesIfNeeded`, `recordPrimarySnapshots`, and `accumulateGeneralElectionVotes` live in `src/lib/turn/primaryResolution.ts`; `resolveGeneralElections` lives in `src/lib/turn/electionResolution.ts`.

### Country System

The election engine uses country-aware party lookups:

```typescript
majorPartySet = getMajorPartiesForRegion(countryId, parentRegionId);
```

`getMajorPartiesForRegion()` has region-specific overrides (e.g. UK Scotland → SNP/Labour, UK Wales → Labour/Conservative, UK Northern Ireland → DUP/Sinn Féin, Japan Kansai → Ishin/LDP) and falls back to each country's configured `majorPartyIds` otherwise. There is no "CA" (Canada) country; the roster currently spans US, UK, JP, DE, DD, FR, IT, ES, SE, TR, AT, FI, GR, IE, CN, RU, PL, HU, RO, BG, YU, CS, NG, and BR.

## Error Handling

- Missing demographics → equal vote split
- Zero total weight → equal vote split
- Withdrawn candidates → excluded from vote share calculations
- Tally cleanup → `removeWithdrawnCandidateFromTally()` removes votes/data

## Performance Optimizations

### Preloading

`accumulateVoteTurn()` accepts a `preload` option to batch database queries:

```typescript
options?: {
  approvalMap?: Map<string, number>;
  preload?: {
    stateMap: Map<string, State>;
    demographicsMap: Map<string, StateDemographics>;
    categories: DemographicCategory[];
    statePartyOrgsByState: Map<string, StatePartyOrg[]>;
  };
}
```

### Caching

- Party org lookups use `Map<string, number>`
- Approval scalars pre-calculated in approvalMap
- Demographic categories fetched once per election

## Swing-Flow Driver Modifiers

The swing-flow engine (`voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`) layers several driver modules on top of the base appeal/reach/approval calculation. Each is optional (no-ops when its inputs are absent) and each has its own dedicated file under `src/lib/electionEngine/`.

### Coattails (`coattailMagnitude.ts`, `govCoattail.ts`, `presidentialCoattail.ts`)

A sitting executive's approval swings a nominal-share multiplier for their own party in every eligible down-ballot general in scope, governor coattails at state scope, presidential coattails at national scope. Shared math (`coattailMagnitude.ts`):

```typescript
approvalCoattailMultiplier(approval) =
  1 + clamp((approval - BASE_APPROVAL) / COATTAIL_APPROVAL_SATURATION, -1, 1) × COATTAIL_MAX_BONUS
```

An executive exactly at `BASE_APPROVAL` (the neutral approval baseline) contributes 1.0× (no-op); above it the party's races get a lift, up to `COATTAIL_MAX_BONUS` at `COATTAIL_APPROVAL_SATURATION` points above baseline; below it, an equal-magnitude drag. `govCoattail.ts` resolves the sitting regional executive per state (preferring the damped stored `stateApprovalHistory` snapshot over a live recompute) and excludes the executive's own race (no self-coattail) and the head-of-government race itself. `presidentialCoattail.ts` mirrors this at national scope, reading the sitting President's party and stored national approval; currently US-only (`HEAD_OF_GOVERNMENT_TYPE_BY_COUNTRY = { US: "president" }`), since non-US heads of government (UK PM, DE chancellor, JP shugiin) aren't wired in yet. Coattails apply as a **nominal-share multiplier**, not as a persuasion-driver component, kept separate so they don't get double-counted against the incumbency driver below.

### Median-Voter Driver (`medianVoter.ts`)

Replaces the policy-distance driver's old hard-coded `(0, 0)` centrism reference with the state's actual turnout-weighted median voter: `computeMedianVoter()` averages each demographic group's economic/social lean, weighted by `categoryWeight × populationPct × turnoutPct`. It is a weighted average, not a true statistical median, deliberate, since per-voter modeling isn't part of this engine. For US presidential races specifically, `computeNationalEvWeightedMedian()` aggregates each state's median EV-weighted (a 55-EV state pulls the national signal 55× harder than a 3-EV state) rather than population-weighted, reflecting that campaigns court the Electoral College map, not raw population. `usesEvWeightedNationalMedian()` gates this to US president only; other head-of-government races still use the state/national default. Zero-weight or mirror-symmetric inputs return the neutral `{ ep: 0, sp: 0 }`.

### Persuasion Drivers (`persuasionDrivers.ts`)

`persuasionDrivers(pj, pi, ...)` sums four independently-budgeted components into a signed `[-1, +1]` contribution describing how much of `pi`'s marginal support swings toward `pj`:

| Component | Budget | Shape |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Candidate Support delta | `SUPPORT_DELTA_BUDGET = 0.30` | Linear on the Support-stat gap between the two parties' representative candidates |
| Policy distance | `POLICY_DISTANCE_BUDGET = 0.15` | Distance from the median voter (see above), normalized to the ±4 grid; closer-to-median party gets the positive side |
| Money | `MONEY_BUDGET = 0.20` | log10 ratio of campaign funds, saturating at a 10× advantage |
| Incumbency | `INCUMBENCY_BUDGET = 0.10` | See the 3-way split below |

Budgets sum to 0.75, deliberately under the `[-1, +1]` aggregate clamp so the clamp only activates on driver pile-on, not by structural design. The "representative candidate" for a party in multi-seat races is whichever candidate has the highest Support.

### Party-Tenure Fatigue (`partyTenureFatigue.ts`)

A thermostatic "time for a change" drag applied to a party that has held the executive office for multiple consecutive terms, subtracted **after** the approval shield/drag is computed and capped (so it bites even a popular incumbent sitting at the shield cap):

```typescript
TENURE_FATIGUE_PER_TERM = 0.035  // 3.5 budget-pts per term beyond the first
partyTenureFatiguePenalty(consecutiveTerms) = max(0, floor(consecutiveTerms) - 1) × TENURE_FATIGUE_PER_TERM
```

A party seeking its 2nd term (1 term held) pays 0; 3rd term (2 held) pays −3.5pp; 4th term pays −7.0pp; and so on, +3.5pp per additional term. Folded into the incumbency driver's net value before the shield/drag is applied to challengers.

### Midterm Opposition Boost (`midtermOppositionBoost.ts`)

A modest nominal-share counterweight, `MIDTERM_OPPOSITION_MULTIPLIER = 1.05`, applied to every party **outside** national government (including independents) in elections eligible for it, currently gated to UK Regional Council midterms (`isUKRegionalCouncilMidterm()`). Coalition/confidence partners resolved as governing parties stay neutral; an unresolved or vacant government no-ops instead of boosting everyone. Applied as a `midtermOppositionModifierByParty` multiplier in `voteDistributionSwingFlow.ts`, alongside the coattail and reg-baseline/resistance tilts.

### The 3-Way Incumbency Split (`incumbentSeatShare.ts`, `persuasionDrivers.ts`)

The incumbency driver branches on race type, in priority order:

1. **Single-winner executive own-race** (`incumbentPartyId` set, governor, president, etc.): full-magnitude directional shield/drag scaled by the sitting executive's approval via the **executive approval curve**:
   ```typescript
   approvalAdjustedIncumbencyBudget(approval, pivot = INCUMBENCY_APPROVAL_PIVOT) =
     approval >= pivot
       ? min(INCUMBENCY_SHIELD_MAX, (approval - pivot) × INCUMBENCY_APPROVAL_SLOPE)
       : -min(INCUMBENCY_DRAG_MAX, (pivot - approval) × INCUMBENCY_APPROVAL_SLOPE)
   ```
   `INCUMBENCY_APPROVAL_PIVOT = 46`, `INCUMBENCY_SHIELD_MAX = INCUMBENCY_DRAG_MAX = 0.1` (±10pp), `INCUMBENCY_APPROVAL_SLOPE = 0.01`. The pivot sits below the live national mean, so most incumbents get a smaller shield and only the weakest (~44-46 approval) tip into a mild drag. The party-tenure fatigue penalty is subtracted from this budget before the net is applied.
2. **Single-seat legislative own-race** (`legislativeIncumbentPartyId` set, US Senate): a flat, officeholder-based shield that ignores approval/favorability (already priced in elsewhere) and never becomes a drag: `LEGISLATIVE_INCUMBENCY_SHIELD = 0.06` (+6pp), decaying `LEGISLATIVE_TENURE_FATIGUE_PER_TERM = 0.01` per term beyond the first, floored at `LEGISLATIVE_INCUMBENCY_MIN = 0.01` (+1pp permanent floor).
3. **Multi-seat / legislature fallback** (`incumbentSeatShareByParty` map, from `incumbentSeatShare.ts`): the prior cycle's per-party seat-share (computed by `computeSeatShareFromTally()` from the last resolved tally on the same seat key) scales the shield linearly: `(shareJ − shareI) × INCUMBENCY_BUDGET`. Used for proportional/multi-seat races (US House, UK Regional Council, JP Shugiin/Sangiin, DE Bundestag). Single-seat races deliberately do NOT use this fallback, a two-candidate vote split isn't a meaningful "incumbent share" signal, and returns an empty map (⇒ 0 driver contribution) when there's no prior resolved election on the same seat key.
