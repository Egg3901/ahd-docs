# Achievements

Achievements are badges earned through gameplay. They appear on your profile as a **chunky labeled tile grid** organized by category, and can be highlighted in Settings. Each achievement shows what percentage of players have earned it.

## How It Works

- **Profile Display**: Achievements display as a category-organized tile grid on your profile. Up to 5 achievements can be highlighted as featured. Visitors and you can expand to view all earned achievements. Locked achievements appear grayed out with their unlock criteria visible.
- **Settings**: Go to Settings → Achievement Highlights to choose which 5 to display. Leave slots empty if you prefer.
- **Account-Bound**: Achievements are tied to your account, not your character. They persist across character retirements. The `characterAchievements` collection uses `userId` as the primary FK; `characterId` is optional and tracks which character earned the achievement.
- **Rarity**: "X% of players" shows how many accounts (with at least one character) have each achievement (NPPs are not counted).
- **Categories**: Achievements are grouped by category (Special, Elections, Legislation, Actions, Social, Milestones, in that display order). This is the `AchievementCategory` union in `src/lib/db/types/achievement.ts`: `"milestone" | "election" | "legislation" | "social" | "action" | "special"`. Full definitions live in `src/lib/seeds/achievements.ts` (58 achievements as of this writing).

`awardAchievement`/`awardAchievements` also runs `maybeAwardCompletionist` after every award, which grants `completionist` once an account holds every other achievement.

Not every achievement goes through `src/lib/achievements/triggers.ts`. Several call `awardAchievement` directly at the point of the game event instead of through a shared trigger function: `lawmaker` (`src/lib/turn/billLifecycle/lifecycleHelpers.ts`, `src/lib/presidentialBillAction.ts`), `cosponsor` (`src/lib/legislature/commands/nationalBillActions.ts`), `donor`/`big_spender` (`src/app/api/v1/transfer/route.ts`, `src/app/api/characters/[id]/transfer/route.ts`), `speaker_candidate` (`src/lib/congress/speaker/actions.ts`), `party_leader` (`src/lib/nationalPartyElections.ts`, `src/lib/statePartyElections.ts`, `src/lib/parties/applyCharacterPartyJoin.ts`, the party leadership appointment route), `policy_shift` (`src/app/api/settings/policy/route.ts`), `first_subscriber` (`src/app/api/characters/[id]/subscribe/route.ts`), and `presidential_nominee` (`src/lib/turn/primaryResolution.ts`). Only `patreon_supporter_plus`, `wiki_contributor`, `party_founder`, and `dealmaker` are seeded `manual_only` with no automatic award path (admin/moderator grant only, via `src/app/api/admin/achievements/grant/route.ts` or `src/app/api/moderator/achievements/grant/route.ts`).

### Award Logic

```typescript
// src/lib/achievements/index.ts

// Single achievement
await awardAchievement(userId, slug, characterId);

// Multiple achievements (batch)
await awardAchievements(userId, [slug1, slug2, ...], characterId);
```

### Action Count Thresholds

```typescript
// src/lib/achievements/triggers.ts:32-49

if (actionType === "fundraise") {
  if (count >= 1) award("first_fundraise");
  if (count >= 10) award("fundraiser");
  if (count >= 50) award("big_fundraiser");
}
if (actionType === "campaign" && count >= 10) award("campaigner");
if (actionType === "buildDonorBase" && count >= 5) award("grassroots");
if (actionType === "advertise" && count >= 3) award("advertiser");
if (actionType === "poll" || actionType === "pollLarge") {
  if (count >= 5) award("pollster");
}
```

### Data Model

| Collection              | Fields                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `achievements`          | Master list of achievement definitions: `slug`, `name`, `description`, `icon`, `category`, `triggerType`, `triggerConfig?`, `isHidden`, `order`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (see `src/lib/db/types/achievement.ts`) |
| `characterAchievements` | `userId`, `characterId?`, `achievementId` (ObjectId reference to `achievements._id`), `earnedAt`, `grantedBy?` |

**Note:** the join field is `achievementId`, an `ObjectId` reference to the achievement's `_id`, not an `achievementSlug` string. `userId` is the primary FK, achievements are account-bound, not character-bound. `characterId` is stored for historical context (which character earned it). Slug-to-`_id` lookups go through `getAchievementBySlug` in `src/lib/achievements/index.ts`.
