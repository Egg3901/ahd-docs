## Architecture Pattern

### Request Flow

- **Next.js App Router** handles all UI (React Server Components + client components) and API routes. No separate backend server.
- All game logic lives in API routes (`src/app/api/`). Domain logic is extracted into service modules under `src/lib/`.
- **Client-server communication** is primarily HTTP. The active client hook polls `/api/game/turn/status` and synthesizes turn events; `src/lib/events.ts` provides a lightweight in-process event emitter for turn/theme events, but it is not a durable cross-instance push bus.

### Turn Processor

- `processTurn()` in `src/lib/turnSystem.ts` is the single entry point. It is fired in-process by `node-cron` (`src/lib/cron.ts`), scheduled from `instrumentation.ts` at server boot, not by an external cron service. Schedule is `0 * * * *` (hourly), or `0,30 * * * *` when `GameState.fastMode` is on. `GET /api/cron/turn` also exists as an HTTP-triggerable fallback (protected by `requireCron()`/`CRON_SECRET`) with a `30 * * * *` backup fire that only runs if the primary missed its slot.
- The phase list now lives in a registry (`src/simulation/phases/turnPhaseRegistry.ts`, phase names enumerated in `src/simulation/phases/turnPhaseNames.ts`) rather than being inlined in `turnSystem.ts`. `BASE_TURN_PHASE_NAMES` currently has **123 phases**, plus per-country election phases from `COUNTRY_ELECTION_PHASES`. Each phase runs through the shared turn-phase runtime (`src/simulation/engine/turnPhaseRuntime.ts`), failures log to Sentry but don't halt subsequent phases.
- **Election-resolution ordering is critical:** primaries must resolve before vote accumulation; votes must accumulate before timers advance; timers must advance before elections resolve. The table below groups phases by concern; it is illustrative, not an exhaustive phase-by-phase listing (see the registry files for the full current set, which also includes governor/SCOTUS, extraction/prospecting, decolonization, spheres of influence, impeachment, by-elections, and ledger-reconciliation phases not shown below).

| 6. Campaigns & actions     | `campaignTurn`, `nppActionProcessing`, `activityLogging`                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Activity summary after action phases                |

| 11. Effects & regional ops | `policyEffects`, `demographicEffects`, `policyReactionDecay`, `archetypeApprovalDecay`, `unownedSectorGrowth`, `metricDecay`, `subsidyBudget`, `regionalBudgetProcessing`, `jpRegionalBudgetProcessing`, `deRegionalBudgetProcessing`, `crisisTurn`, `ministerialOrders`     | Parallel-safe state/regional updates                |
| 12. National aggregation   | `gdpGrowth`, `nationalMetrics`, `tradeGrowthMirror`, `inflationRecalc`, `forexTurn`, `centralBankChairTurn`, `centralBankChairSelection`                                                                                                                                     | Ordered; forex is gated by `GameState.forexEnabled` |
| 13. History & health       | `metricHistory`, `approvalSnapshot`, `interestRateSnapshot`, `partyHistorySnapshot`, `gameHealthSnapshot`, `suspiciousDetection`                                                                                                                                             | After metrics and central-bank updates              |

- Server-enforced `lastTurnProcessed` timestamp prevents clock drift. `getGameTime()` uses this as `effectiveNow`, not `new Date()`, so election phase display stays correct even after batch turns.
- `src/lib/cabinetTransition.ts` (`clearCabinetOnTransition`), clears all cabinet members when a new president takes office; called from election resolution, not the turn loop directly.

### Multi-Country Support

- 29 country configs in `COUNTRY_CONFIGS` (`src/lib/constants/countries.ts`), covering the US, UK, and Ireland/Scotland/Wales alongside a broader eastern-bloc and western-Europe roster (Japan, China, Nigeria, Brazil, France, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, Greece, Austria, Finland, and the RU/DD/PL/CS/HU/RO/BG/YU/UKR/BLR/BAL one-party-bloc set). Raw string literals (`"US"`, `"UK"`, etc.) are banned by a custom ESLint rule (`local/no-country-literals`), use `CountryId`/`COUNTRY_CONFIGS`.
- Each country has its own legislature type (Congress / House of Commons / National Diet / etc.), election schedule, and regional structure, driven by per-country config rather than hardcoded branching.
- UK: House of Commons (650 seats, 480-turn cycles); constituency MPs stored in `electedOfficials`.
- JP: National Diet (Shugiin 465 seats + Sangiin 248 seats); full bill lifecycle via `jpBillLifecycle`; snap elections supported.
- Germany: active configuration with Bundestag/Bundesrat labels, Chancellor executive, EUR/ECB currency mapping, DAX exchange, and DE regional budget processing.

## Communication & Notifications

### Notifications

- Stored in MongoDB `notifications` collection; surfaced on next page load.
- 129 notification types (`NOTIFICATION_TYPES` in `src/lib/db/types/notifications.ts`): election results, leadership events, bill lifecycle, cabinet, party events, NPP influence, achievements, and more.
- UI: paginated list, type filter, search, bulk delete, mark-all-read, URL-based filters, date grouping.

### Hero Image System

- Tall gradient banners proxied through `/api/images/hero/[slug]` (avoids Wikimedia hotlinking). Cached 24 hours.
- Slug set covers government/institution banners per country (`white-house`, `house-of-commons`, `downing-street`, `national-diet`, `bank-of-england`, `federal-reserve`, `great-hall-of-the-people`, etc.) plus one banner per commodity sector (`commodity-steel`, `commodity-oil`, `commodity-software`, ...). See `HERO_URLS` in `src/app/api/images/hero/[slug]/route.ts` for the current list.
- Component: `<HeroImage>` (`src/components/HeroImage.tsx`) wraps Next.js `<Image>` with the proxy URL.

### Toast Notifications

- Client-side feedback via `useToast()` from `@/contexts/ToastContext`.
- Usage: `showToast("Message", "success" | "error" | "info")`.

## Deployment Considerations

### Hosting

- **App**: Deployed on Railway (`railway.toml`, Nixpacks build, `next start`). Any Node.js-compatible host would work in principle, but the boot path (`instrumentation.ts` starting `node-cron`, `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size` heap cap, `/api/health` healthcheck) is tuned for Railway specifically.
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted.
- **Cron**: `node-cron` (`src/lib/cron.ts`) runs inside the Next.js process, started from `instrumentation.ts` at boot, the same in every environment, not just locally. `GET /api/cron/turn` exists as an HTTP-triggerable fallback protected by `CRON_SECRET`, but the primary turn cron is in-process, not an external scheduler.

### Scaling

- **DB indexes**: managed via versioned migration entries under `src/lib/migrations/entries/` and the index seeder (`src/lib/admin/seed/seedIndexes.ts`); too many to enumerate here.
- **Turn processor**: Single-threaded sequential; `/api/cron/turn` allows up to `maxDuration = 800` seconds for the full phase pipeline, well above the old 60-second target.
- **Game time cache**: `getGameTime()` caches for 5 seconds; invalidated explicitly by `sync-date`.

## Security & Fairness

- All game logic validated server-side. Client actions verified before execution.
- Server-enforced `lastTurnProcessed` timestamps prevent clock manipulation.
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (elections, Congress, feedback).
- Custom ESLint rule `local/no-country-literals` prevents hardcoded country ID comparisons.
- Admin routes require `requireAdmin()`; cron routes require `requireCron()` with `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`.
