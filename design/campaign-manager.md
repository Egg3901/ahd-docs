# Campaign Manager System

The Campaign Manager is scoped to **US presidential races only** (more precisely: `electionType === "president"` AND the country's `executiveFormation === "direct_election"`). Senate, house, governor, UK commons, JP shugiin / sangiin, and other parliamentary races run candidates, endorsements, and vote tallies without a Campaign doc.

When a candidate enters a US presidential race (primary or general), `POST /api/elections/[id]/enter` calls `createInitialCampaign`, gated by `isCampaignEligibleElection`. The same gate is enforced in admin routes (`start-general`, `place-candidate`) so a future non-direct-election "president" office (e.g. parliament-appointed figurehead) will not spawn a Campaign Manager pool.

Each eligible candidacy has an associated campaign with a dedicated page at `/campaign/[id]`. The page adapts based on who is viewing it.

## Access Tiers

| Viewer                   | Access Level    | What They See                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Campaign owner**       | Full management | All tabs: overview, upgrades, donations, activity log, settings |
| **Same-party member**    | Intelligence    | Basic candidate info, endorsement count, public upgrade levels  |
| **Public / other party** | Summary         | Candidate name, party, office sought, public stats only         |

This creates a "fog of war" mechanic: players cannot see the full details of opponents' campaigns.

## Campaign Resources

Each campaign has two independent resource pools:

- **Campaign Funds**, Earned from fundraising income per turn, player donations, and party donations. Spent on upgrades.
- **Campaign Actions**, Generated per turn from endorsements (`1 + floor(sqrt(endorsements) × 3)`, minimum 1). Spent on upgrades.

These are entirely separate from the candidate's personal funds and character actions.

## Strategic Operations (Branch Trees)

Campaigns invest in four levers, each a **starter unlock + three branch sub-tracks** (Strategic Operations v2), not a single flat 0-10/0-5 level. Unlocking a lever's starter node gates its branches; each branch then levels independently 1-3 (`OPS_MAX_BRANCH_LEVEL = 3`). Source: `src/lib/campaigns/upgradeCosts.ts` (`OPS_TREES`), owner-facing tree state in `src/lib/campaigns/dto/campaignView.ts`.

| Lever                    | Starter unlock             | Branches                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fundraising**           | +$35k/turn base income      | **Grassroots** (steady recurring income), **Bundlers** (one-time cash infusion on purchase), **Direct Mail** (multiplies ALL campaign income) |
| **Ground Game**           | base swing-area boost       | **Field Offices** (swing-area performance), **Get-Out-The-Vote** (smaller boost across ALL areas), **Volunteer Corps** (cuts ground game's ongoing upkeep) |
| **Media Spending**        | base favorability gain      | **Broadcast**, **Television** (cheaper favorability, lower upkeep), **Rapid Response** (blunts opponents' opposition research against you) |
| **Opposition Research**   | base favorability drain     | **Dossier** (recurring drain on your target), **Scandal Leak** (one-time hit to current target), **Counter-Intel** (amplifies your recurring drain) |

A legacy flat `fundraisingLevel` / `mediaSpendingLevel` / `groundGameLevel` / `oppositionResearchLevel` (0-10 / 0-5) still exists on the `Campaign` doc as a migrated summary (`migrateCampaignOpsTrees` maps old levels onto a starter + branch state); the branch trees are the live mechanic players invest in.

Upgrade costs are **1.5× higher** once the election enters the general phase (`primaryEndTime ≤ now < endTime`).

## Opposition Research

Purchasing opposition research requires selecting a target. The target's favorability drains passively each turn based on your level.

- **Retargeting**, Change your target at any time via the campaign page. A **6-hour cooldown** (`oppositionResearchCooldownUntil`) applies between retargets.
- `POST /api/campaigns/[id]/retarget`, Owner or manager only; requires `oppositionResearchLevel > 0`.

## Campaign Season Multiplier

In the final 4 turns before `election.endTime`, all passive effects from media spending and opposition research are automatically doubled (2×). No player action required.

## Donations

Any authenticated player can donate personal Cash on Hand to any active campaign (minimum $1). The national party chair can donate from the party treasury.

- **Donation log**, All donations are recorded in `campaign.donationLog` (last 100 entries). Fields: donor name, donor type (`"character"` | `"party"`), amount, turn number.
- `POST /api/campaigns/[id]/donate`, Body: `{ amount: number, partyId?: string }`. Omit `partyId` for personal donation; include it for a party donation (chair authorization required).

## Manager Assignment

An admin can assign a campaign manager character to any campaign:

- **API**: `POST /api/admin/campaigns/[id]/assign-manager`
- **Effect**: The assigned character gains limited management access to the campaign
- **Use case**: Party leadership delegating campaign oversight

## Endorsements

NPP endorsements are now **manual-only**. They come from explicit asks in the
player-to-NPP interaction panel rather than organic turn-time re-evaluation.
The endorsement check stays hidden from players, but the panel shows a
`Likely to Accept` / `Likely to Decline` chip based on current relationship and
policy fit. For **presidential elections**, player endorsements also count
toward the campaign actions formula. For all other race types, player
endorsements are cosmetic only.

Active NPP endorsements now matter in two ways:

- they continue to feed campaign action generation
- they also add a small capped direct favorability boost in race calculations so endorsements are not purely an action-economy stat
