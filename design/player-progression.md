## US Career Path

### Phase 1: Build Foundation

- Players start as independents with no office
- Build stats: Political Influence, Favorability, Donor Base
- Raise funds through Fundraising and per-turn fund generation
- Can campaign, fundraise, build donor base, run ads, commission polls
- Can Support/Attack other politicians (raise or lower their Favorability)
- Can Barnstorm for allies (5 actions + $100k to boost their Political Influence)
- Can boost/influence NPPs from their profile pages
- **Cannot** write bills or vote on legislation

### Phase 2: Join Party

- Join Democrat, Republican, or a custom party (required before running for office)
- Party membership starts building **Party Influence** - the higher your party influence relative to other members, the more bonus actions you receive each turn from the party pool
- Policy alignment to the party platform amplifies how efficiently your party influence converts to bonus actions
- Can switch parties later (with stat penalties: Favorability and PI drop)

### Phase 3: Primary Election

- Declare candidacy during primary phase (before `primaryEndTime`)
- Primary resolution uses **primary score** (alignment to party position + favorability + influence)
  - State races (House, Senate, Governor, State Senate): uses **Political Influence (PI)**
  - Presidential race: uses **National Political Influence (NPI)**
- Highest primary score per party advances to the general
- See [Election Mechanics](./elections.md)

### Phase 4: General Election

- Compete against other party nominees
- Vote accumulation each turn; final 4 turns worth 25% of pool
- Sustained campaigning matters; policy alignment and Favorability affect votes
- **State races**: Political Influence (PI) drives reach and appeal
- **Presidential race**: NPI drives reach and appeal - uncapped, logarithmic scaling rewards long-term accumulation
- Winner takes office

#### Presidential Candidate: Travel

During a presidential **general election**, active candidates can **Travel** to any US state (5 actions). While traveling:

- You earn **+1% Favorability per turn** passively (no action needed)
- Your travel state appears as a badge on the electoral map and candidate row, signaling your focus to opponents
- Switching states costs another 5 actions
- Strategic travel compensates for lower NPI in swing states

### Phase 5: In Office

- Gain bonus actions per turn (tiered by office)
- Can write bills (if in Congress)
- Can vote on legislation (if in Congress)
- Voting shifts policy positions (±0.25 per vote in direction of bill)
- Per-turn fund generation includes office bonus
- Face re-election at end of term

### Phase 6: Re-Election / Advancement

- Run for re-election in same office
- Or seek higher office (House → Senate → Governor → President)
- Only one office at a time
- **Note**: Moving toward a presidential run shifts the key influence stat from PI to NPI. NPI accrues passively every turn (+state PI ÷ 100), so maintaining high state influence early accelerates NPI growth

## UK Career Path

### Phase 1: Build Foundation (same as US)

- Build PI, Favorability, Donor Base; join a party before running

### Phase 2: Commons Election

- UK players run in **regional Commons elections** for England, Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland
- Multi-seat proportional allocation - more than one candidate per party can win seats in the same region
- Candidacy limited to your home region

### Phase 3: Hold an MP Seat

- **MPs**: Vote on UK legislation passing through Parliament
- Fund generation and action bonuses work the same as US offices
- Face re-election each Commons cycle (perpetual scheduling)

### Phase 4: Prime Minister

- After each Commons cycle resolves, seat totals are summed nationally by party
- The **largest-party leader** is nominated as Prime Minister candidate
- A **confidence vote** among all MPs determines whether they're confirmed
- Confirmed PMs gain the highest action bonus and fund generation in the game
- **No-confidence motions**: MPs from the ruling block can trigger a vote to remove the sitting PM; if it passes, a new confidence process begins
- Use the UK Government hub at `/executive/uk` for seat totals, government status, and confidence votes

## Party Influence Over Time

Party Influence accrues passively each turn you're a member and accumulates relative to other party members. It translates to **bonus actions per turn** from the shared party pool:

- Members with high party influence extract more bonus actions each turn
- Policy closeness to the party's platform amplifies efficiency
- Staying active and invested in party operations keeps your standing high
- Leaving and rejoining a party resets your Party Influence to 0

Party Influence is visible on your profile (Party Standing section) and in the party members table. See [Political Parties](./parties.md) for the full calculation.
