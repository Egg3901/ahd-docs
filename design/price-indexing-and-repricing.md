# Price Indexing & Nominal Repricing

**Status:** Partially shipped. The household price index described below now
exists; full nominal repricing of constants remains a plan.
**Scope:** Cumulative price-level index per country, global weighted inflation series for the forex page, and a nominal-repricing layer for in-game constants (commodity base prices, action costs, startup capital).

**Reviewed against:** `src/lib/budget/inflation.ts`, `src/lib/turn/inflationRecalc.ts`, `src/lib/turn/interestRateSnapshot.ts`, `src/lib/db/types/marketCapHistory.ts`, `src/lib/constants/exchangeRegistry.ts`, `src/lib/constants/commodities.ts`, `docs/design/currency-exchange.md`.

## 1. What the stored inflation value actually represents

The per-turn `budget.economicFactors.inflationRate` is an **annualized inflation estimate for this turn's conditions**. It is not a measured trailing 48-turn rate. Inflation uses `INERTIA = 0.35` plus mean reversion in `src/lib/budget/inflation.ts`.

The shipped country household index lives in
`src/lib/economy/householdPriceIndex.ts`. It starts at 1.0 and advances each
turn using 75% CPI passthrough divided by `TURNS_PER_YEAR`. The real-economy
panel uses it to deflate median income. It does not yet reprice commodity bases,
action costs, startup capital, or the other constants proposed later in this
document.

Consequence: we cannot sum/average these values across turns to get "cumulative inflation." We need a separately-maintained **price-level index**.

## 2. Price-level index - math bridge

- Fix `TURNS_PER_YEAR = 48` (already constant in `turnTime.ts`).
- Convention: the per-turn compounding factor is
  `factor_t = (1 + π_t/100)^(1/48)`
  where `π_t` is the stored annualized rate for turn `t`.
- Country price level: `P_{t+1}^c = P_t^c × factor_t^c`, with `P_0^c = 100` at a fixed **base turn** (recommend the first turn the index ships; or game genesis, with backfill from existing `inflationHistory` for the subset of turns still retained).
- "Cumulative inflation since base" = `P_t / P_0 - 1` (derive in UI; don't store the delta).

**Note on convention:** This is a forward-looking compounding of a rolling annualized estimate - not a retrospective YoY. Document this so nobody later "fixes" it by replacing with a 48-turn trailing average (which would subtly change the meaning of the index).

## 3. Storage - a separate, uncapped collection

`CentralBank.inflationHistory` is pruned to `FOREX_AND_MACRO_CHART_HISTORY_TURNS` (240 turns = 5 in-game years). A cumulative index **must not** live in a capped ring buffer or it loses its base.

Proposal:

- **New collection `priceLevelHistory`**
  ```ts
  interface PriceLevelSnapshot {
    _id: ObjectId;
    countryId: CountryId; // or "global"
    turn: number;
    level: number; // P_t, with P at baseTurn = 100
    yoyAnnualized: number; // source signal that was compounded this turn (for audit)
  }
  ```
  Indexed `{ countryId: 1, turn: 1 }` unique, and `{ turn: 1 }` for global queries. **Uncapped.**
- **New doc `priceLevels` (one per country + one `_id: "global"`)**
  ```ts
  interface PriceLevelState {
    _id: CountryId | "global";
    baseTurn: number;
    baseValue: 100;
    level: number; // current P_t
    lastTurn: number;
    updatedAt: Date;
  }
  ```
  Single-row "current" read path; the history collection is for charting and backfill.

Why two: the "current" doc gives O(1) reads for the repricing resolver (hot path); the history collection gives charting without inflating the central-bank document.

## 4. Global weighted inflation series

For the forex page's per-turn global number:

```
π_global_t = Σ_c w_{c,t} × π_{c,t}
```

### 4a. Weight choice - recommended default: GDP

Market-cap weighting creates a feedback loop: high-inflation country → nominal market cap up → larger weight in global inflation → loops back into macro signals the chart plots. Options:

| Weight                                      | Pros                                      | Cons                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **GDP (same-turn)**                         | Smoother, inflation-neutral in real terms | Also drifts w/ nominal GDP growth            |
| **Real market cap** (cap / own price level) | Removes inflation feedback                | Adds one extra division, less intuitive      |
| **Lagged market cap (t-1)**                 | Simple, breaks tight feedback             | Still nominal; minor feedback at cycle scale |
| **Market cap (same-turn)**                  | Most "financial-markets" flavor           | Strong feedback loop (reject)                |

**Default for the cumulative global index: GDP-weighted.**
**Acceptable for the forex-page YoY chart (where financial-market context is appropriate): lagged market cap, read from `marketCapHistory.exchangeCaps`** via `exchangeRegistry`'s 1:1 exchange↔country mapping. These can legitimately be two different series - label both clearly.

### 4b. Global price level

Compound the weighted per-period factor into a **global** `priceLevels` row keyed `_id: "global"`. Use the **same weights** each turn for internal consistency (weight by GDP share **or** cap share - don't mix per panel).

## 5. API + chart

- Extend `GET /api/forex/monetary-policy` (or add a sibling `/api/forex/inflation-global`) to return:
  - per-country `inflationHistory` (already shipped - YoY per turn)
  - per-country `priceLevelHistory` (new, cumulative)
  - global `inflationHistory` (weighted YoY per turn)
  - global `priceLevelHistory` (cumulative)
  - the weight basis used (`"gdp"` or `"marketCap_t-1"`) so the client can label the series honestly.
- **New dedicated chart** on the forex monetary-policy tab - "Global inflation tracker" - with two modes:
  - **YoY** (shows per-country lines + global weighted line)
  - **Cumulative** (shows per-country `P_t/P_0 - 1` + global `P_t/P_0 - 1`)
- Do **not** overload `GlobalMonetaryPolicyChart.tsx` - it already multiplexes inflation/interest/GDP with a metric picker.

## 6. Nominal repricing layer

### 6a. Rule

- **Constants stay in real (2020-era) terms.** `COMMODITY_BASE_PRICES`, any startup-capital scalar, action-cost scalars.
- **In-flight balances stay nominal.** `currencyBalances.*`, party treasury, corporation cash. Do not re-scale these - doing so double-scales when they are spent against a nominal constant that is also being scaled.
- A single resolver converts constants → runtime amounts at read time:
  ```ts
  nominalCredits(realBase: number, countryId: CountryId | "global", turn?: number): number
  ```
  Implementation: `realBase × priceLevels[{countryId or "global"}].level / 100`.

### 6b. Per-country vs global deflator

Default: **per-country**. A US player's action cost is scaled by US's price level; a JP player's by JP's. This is fairer cross-country.

Override to global: a small whitelist (effectively "the world market") - e.g. `COMMODITY_BASE_PRICES`, the anchor for `commodityPressure`. The resolver accepts `"global"` as an explicit scope.

### 6c. Forex baselines and commodity base prices are NOT repriced

- `ExchangeRate.baseRate` - "initial calibration, never changes" per `currency-exchange.md`. **Leave fixed.** `forexPressure = rate/baseRate - 1` is the cost-push signal - rebasing kills it.
- `COMMODITY_BASE_PRICES` - anchors `commodityPressure = P_national/basePrice - 1`. **Leave fixed.** If we later want basePrice to track inflation, `commodityPressure` must be redefined as a velocity signal; that is a **separate** design decision and out of scope for this doc.

### 6d. What the resolver applies to (audit)

The plan's "inventory" must be a grep-based discovery, not a guess. Starting commands:

```bash
grep -rn "funds:\s*[0-9]\|cashOnHand:\s*[0-9]" src/     # startup/hardcoded funds
grep -rn "estimatedCost\|COST\|_COST\s*=" src/lib        # action/fundraise cost constants
grep -rn "COMMODITY_BASE_PRICES\|basePrice\b" src/       # commodity anchors (most are off-limits - see 6c)
grep -rn "STARTING_\|INITIAL_\|DEFAULT_" src/lib/constants
```

For each hit, decide: (a) real constant → route through resolver, (b) already nominal balance → leave alone, (c) locked anchor (forex baseline, commodity base) → **do not touch**.

## 7. Feedback-loop check (mandatory before ship)

Add a test that simulates a one-shot rate shock and verifies inflation/forex/commodity-pressure **converge** rather than diverge over, say, 100 turns. Flag anything that explodes.

## 8. Golden tests

- Flat 2% YoY for 48 consecutive turns → cumulative `P_48/P_0 - 1 ≈ 0.02` (within a documented ε for the compounding approximation).
- `nominalCredits(realBase, c, t)` round-trip: `realFromNominal(nominalCredits(x, c, t), c, t) === x` within ε.
- Global weighted YoY for a hand-constructed 3-country fixture matches manual arithmetic under both GDP and market-cap weights.
- Turn-ordering test: index writer runs **after** `inflationRecalc` (so it reads the settled rate) and **independently of** `interestRateSnapshot` (which still writes the capped history for charts).

## 9. Phased sequencing

1. **Math + storage** - write `priceLevels` + `priceLevelHistory`, add the writer phase, seed one base snapshot. No consumers yet.
2. **Validate** - let it run one game-day (48 turns) in dev; sanity-check that a flat 2% produces ~2% cumulative.
3. **Forex page series** - add API fields + dedicated "Global inflation tracker" chart. Only after (2) is stable.
4. **Repricing layer** - introduce `nominalCredits()` resolver; audit constants via greps in 6d; route real constants through the resolver. Nominal balances untouched.
5. **Docs** - update `currency-exchange.md` and `economic-systems.md` with links to this doc and the weight-basis decision.

## 10. Known tensions / open questions

- **Index base turn when backfilled vs fresh start.** If we backfill from existing `inflationHistory` (which only retains the last 240 turns), the base will be "240 turns ago," not game genesis. Fine for a soft launch but the chart legend should say "since turn N" rather than "since game start."
- **Currency redenomination is not in scope.** If inflation runs very hot for a very long time, nominal balances will eventually look absurd ("¥500,000 action cost"). Handling that is a future product decision (either redenominate or cap cumulative drift), not something this layer solves.
- **Admin debug UI** - a single page showing each country's current `level`, weight-basis used, and last N periods of compounding factors would make the feedback-loop check and balance tuning dramatically easier. Not required for v1 but strongly recommended before shipping the repricing layer.
