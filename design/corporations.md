# Corporations

The corporation system lets players found and manage businesses that operate across state economies. Corporations generate revenue, employ workers, and interact with state metrics to create economic feedback loops between legislation and business outcomes.

## Founding a Corporation

- **Cost:** $1,000,000 (deducted from character's cash on hand)
- **Starting capital:** $1,000,000 liquid capital
- **CEO shares:** 10,000,000 shares at $0.10 initial price
- **Requirement:** One corporation per character
- **Starting marketing strength:** 10 (`marketingStrength`, used for market capture; grows further from marketing spend each turn)

Players choose from 17 sector types:

| Sector              | Label                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| financial           | Financial                      |

## Sector Expansion

Corporations expand into state markets by acquiring sectors. Each state's total sector market size is derived from its GDP:

```
stateMarketPerSector = stateGDP (millions) x 100 / 17 sectors
```

- **Expansion cost:** $100,000 base per new state sector
- **Starting revenue:** $1,000,000 per sector
- **Starting workers:** 500 per sector
- **Default profit margin:** 35%

### Market Capture

Unowned market share can be captured via "splits":

- **Cash cost:** 5% of unowned sector revenue (`SPLIT_COST_FRACTION`)
- **MS cost:** Escalates with each split, 1 MS, then 2, 4, 8, 16... (formula: `2^splitEscalation`)
- **Escalation decay:** Each turn, escalation level decreases by 1 (cost halves). After reaching 4 MS cost, next turn it's 2, then 1.
- **Base capture:** 5% of unowned sector at 0 marketing strength (`SPLIT_BASE_CAPTURE_FRACTION`)
- **Marketing bonus:** Additional capture scales with `marketingStrength / 100` (`MS_CAPTURE_DIVISOR`)

The escalation prevents spam-splitting while the decay ensures the cost resets over time. Players must balance split frequency against MS reserves.

### Unowned Sector Regeneration

Unowned sectors are persistent documents that **grow each turn** at the average growth rate of same-type same-state corporate sectors (fallback 1%/turn if no corps exist). This means unowned market share naturally regenerates over time instead of being permanently drained. Splitting reduces the unowned doc's revenue; growth restores it. See `src/lib/turn/unownedSectorGrowth.ts` for the turn phase implementation.

### Vacant CEO market decay

Player corporations with **no active CEO** (`ceoId` unset/null or `ceoVacant: true`) lose **10% per turn** of each owned sector’s **revenue** and **workers**; that revenue is **$inc**’d into the matching `(stateId, sectorType)` unowned sector document (same pool splits draw from). **State-owned / nationalized** corporations (`countryOwnerId` set or `isNationalized`) are excluded so public enterprises do not bleed. Runs at the start of `processCorporationTurn` (after lookups, before sector P&L) in `src/lib/turn/corporation/vacantCeoSectorShed.ts`.

## Per-Turn Processing

Every turn (24 turns per game-day), each corporation is processed:

**Entry point:** `src/lib/turn/corporationTurn.ts` → `processCorporationTurn()`

### Processing Phases

| Phase | Action                                                           | Code Location                     |

### Sector Calculations

For each sector:

1. **Revenue growth:** `newRevenue = revenue × (1 + growthRate / TURNS_PER_DAY / 100)`
2. **Growth cost:** `calculateDailyGrowthCost(newRevenue, perTurnGrowthRate, primeRate)`, scales with prime rate
3. **Profit margin modifiers:** 15+ additive modifiers (unemployment, grid, corruption, commodities, tariffs, subsidies, etc.)
4. **Effective margin:** `min(100, baseMargin + totalModifier)`, can go negative (loss-making)
5. **Maintenance:** `hourlyRevenue × (1 - effectiveMargin / 100)`
6. **Sector NPV:** `yearlyProfit / 0.15` (15% discount rate, `NPV_ANNUAL_DISCOUNT_RATE`), for balance sheet valuation

### Corporate Tax

**Entry point:** `src/lib/turn/corporation/sectorCalculations.ts` (per-sector apportionment loop)

Each jurisdiction sets two independent corporate tax rates, a **domestic rate** (applied to corps headquartered in the same country as the sector) and a **foreign rate** (applied to corps headquartered elsewhere). Rates are selected per-sector:

```typescript
const isDomestic = corp.countryId === sector.countryId;
const federalRate = isDomestic
  ? (lookups.domesticCorpTaxRateByCountry.get(sector.countryId) ?? 0)
  : (lookups.foreignCorpTaxRateByCountry.get(sector.countryId) ?? 0);
const stateRate = isDomestic
  ? (lookups.domesticStateCorpTaxRateByState.get(sector.stateId) ?? 0)
  : (lookups.foreignStateCorpTaxRateByState.get(sector.stateId) ?? 0);
```

- **Tax base:** Per-sector apportioned operating income (see the design archive).
- **Classification:** `isDomestic = corp.countryId === sector.countryId`. A US-HQ corp with a UK sector pays the UK **foreign** rate on that sector's profits; a UK-HQ corp with a UK sector pays the UK **domestic** rate. State tier follows the same rule (country-level match, not state-level).
- **Foreign is all-or-nothing:** there is no country-targeting lever. Each country sets one foreign rate, applied symmetrically to every non-domestic corp operating there.
- **Bond coupon income** is taxed at the corp's home-country **domestic** rate (always domestic from the corp's perspective). State tier never taxes bond interest.
- **Losses:** No tax credits, unprofitable sectors pay $0 regardless of classification. Loss-making corps with all-negative sectors pay 0 in both tiers.

Rates are stored on `federalBudget.taxRates.{domestic,foreign}CorporateTax` and `stateBudgets.taxRates.{domestic,foreign}CorporateTax`, populated by the `*_domestic_corporate_tax_rate` and `*_foreign_corporate_tax_rate` legislation bills per country. See the design archive for the political-economy rationale and stance distribution.

### Tariff & Subsidy Modifiers

**Entry point:** `src/lib/turn/corporation/sectorCalculations.ts:137-162`

**Foreign tariff penalty:** Corps operating outside home country pay margin penalty based on target country's tariff rates against corp's home country.

**Domestic tariff malus:** Home-country corps absorb supply-chain friction from broad tariffs (smaller penalty).

**Tariff blend weights:** Commodity modifiers blend 75% global + 25% local prices; weights shift toward local when tariffs are active.

**Subsidy bonus:** `+15pp` margin per active subsidy (federal + state stack). Qualifying sectors:

- Federal subsidies: Match by `sectorType`
- State subsidies: Match by `sectorType` + `stateId`

Functions: `getForeignTariffMarginModifier()`, `getDomesticTariffMalus()`, `getTariffBlendWeights()`, `getSubsidyMarginModifier()`

### Income Distribution

```typescript
// 1. Corporate tax
corporateTaxOwed = incomePreDividends × (taxRate / 100)

// 2. Dividends (from after-tax income)
afterTaxIncome = incomePreDividends - corporateTaxOwed
hourlyDividendPayout = afterTaxIncome × (dividendRate / 100)

// 3. Final income to corporation
income = incomePreDividends - corporateTaxOwed - hourlyDividendPayout
```

7. **Split escalation decay:** `splitEscalation = max(0, splitEscalation - 1)`, cost halves each turn

Growth rate adjustments cost `revenue x 0.05` per 1% change. Downsizing refunds the same amount.

### CEO Salary (implemented)

The CEO can configure a daily salary paid from the corporation's liquid capital each turn. Salary is set via `POST /api/corporations/[id]/settings` as a daily dollar amount and is divided evenly across `TURNS_PER_DAY` turns.

- **DB field:** `Corporation.ceoSalary?: number` (daily dollar amount)
- **Payment:** Deducted from liquid capital each turn; added to the CEO's personal `cashOnHand`
- **No minimum, but a maximum cap:** salary cannot exceed `CEO_SALARY_MAX_REVENUE_MULTIPLE` (1.25×) of the corporation's total daily gross sector revenue; bond proceeds and coupon income are excluded from that revenue figure, so issuing bonds can never raise the ceiling. At zero gross revenue the cap is $0.
- **Effect on share price:** High salaries drain liquid capital and reduce balance sheet value, which depresses share price over time

### Marketing Budget & Marketing Strength (implemented)

Marketing Strength (MS) determines how much unowned market share is captured per split. It grows each turn based on the marketing budget (daily dollar spend), configured via `POST /api/corporations/[id]/settings`.

**Growth formula per turn:**

```
baseGrowth = 1 MS (if any spend)
scaledGrowth = 0.65 × ln(1 + budget / 100,000)
```

Both values apply diminishing returns once MS exceeds 100, growth slows significantly above that threshold. The formula prevents unlimited MS accumulation through raw spending.

- **Starting MS:** 10
- **Effective range:** 0-200+ (higher MS gives meaningfully more capture per split beyond ~100)
- **Budget is a daily dollar cost** deducted from liquid capital each turn (spread across turns)

Function: `calcMarketingGrowth(dailyBudget, currentStrength)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### R&D Budget & Innovation (implemented)

R&D spending accumulates an **R&D Score** that drives periodic breakthroughs, one-off revenue boosts to a random sector, plus permanent state resource capacity growth for extraction corps. The system mirrors the marketing/logistics pattern for budget handling, score accumulation, and UI surface.

**Score accumulation per turn:**

```
baseGain = 1.0 (if any R&D budget is set)
scaledGain = 0.65 × ln(1 + budget / 100,000)
decay = 3% of current score
newScore = max(0, (1 − decay) × oldScore + (baseGain + scaledGain) × diminishing(oldScore))
```

- **Starting score:** 0
- **Decay:** 3%/turn (slower than logistics 5%, accumulated R&D degrades more slowly than physical infrastructure)
- **Diminishing returns** above score 100 mirror marketing
- **Budget is a daily dollar cost** deducted from liquid capital each turn via the same `costsBeforeCeo` pipeline as marketing and logistics
- **Budget counts against the 150% overhead cap** (`marketing + logistics + R&D + CEO salary ≤ 1.5 × daily revenue`)

Functions: `calcRdGrowth`, `calcRdScoreAfterTurn` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`.

**Innovation check (every 6 turns):**

Each corporation rolls once every `RD_INNOVATION_INTERVAL` turns. Innovation probability scales linearly with score:

```
probability = min(1, rdScore / 200)
```

At score 200 every 6-turn window produces a breakthrough; at 100 one in two windows; at 0 none. rdScore only governs how often a breakthrough fires, the magnitude is a separate uniform random roll, not interpolated from score (an earlier score-interpolated version made high-rdScore corps a guaranteed cap-hit, making R&D strictly dominant over Growth). When a breakthrough fires, one sector owned by the corporation is selected (for extraction corps, the sector closest to its capacity limit; otherwise random):

- **Regular corps:** uniform roll in `[RD_REGULAR_BOOST_MIN, RD_REGULAR_BOOST_MAX]` = 2%-10% revenue boost
- **Extraction corps:** uniform roll in `[RD_EXTRACTION_BOOST_MIN, RD_EXTRACTION_BOOST_MAX]` = 1%-10% revenue boost, _plus_ permanent state resource capacity growth

Boosts are `$inc`'d directly on the sector's revenue in corp-local currency, no FX conversion in the boost path. The breakthrough also fires a `rd_breakthrough` notification to the CEO's user.

**Extraction state capacity growth:**

Each extraction breakthrough increases, for every extractable resource in the **sector's active strategy supply map**, the state's capacity for that resource independently, each resource gets its own uniform random roll of `RD_CAPACITY_BOOST_MIN_PCT` to `RD_CAPACITY_BOOST_MAX_PCT` (1%-15%) of that resource's *current* state capacity:

```
per-resource increase = currentCapacity[resource] × uniformRoll(0.01, 0.15)
```

So the `oil_gas` strategy (produces oil and natural_gas) rolls an independent 1-15% increase for oil and a separate independent 1-15% increase for natural gas, the resources are not splitting a shared pool. States without an existing `stateResourceCapacity` document, or a resource whose current capacity is 0, are skipped.

**Capacity policy (permanent discovery):** capacity is unbounded and has no decay. R&D literally unlocks new deposits, once added, the capacity stays. This contradicts the "fixed capacity per turn" framing in `docs/design/resources.md`; see that doc's note on R&D-driven capacity growth.

States without a `stateResourceCapacity` document are "uncapped" (legacy/pre-migration) and are skipped by the capacity boost, no auto-insertion mid-turn.

**Turn phase:** runs as `Phase 3b` of `processCorporationTurn` (`src/lib/turn/corporation/rdInnovation.ts`), immediately after the base sector writes so the `$inc` composes with the turn's revenue update.

**Key files:**

- `src/lib/turn/corporation/rdInnovation.ts`, innovation phase
- `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`, `RD_*` constants, `calcRdGrowth`, `calcRdScoreAfterTurn`
- `src/lib/corporations/strengthProjection.ts`, net-change projection for the corp page header
- `src/lib/api/schemas/corporations.ts`, settings validation (`rdBudget`)
- `src/components/corporation/ceo/CeoBudgetSubtab.tsx`, CEO budget slider + projection readout

### Production Policy (implemented)

Each sector has a **production policy level**, a continuous numeric scale from **-25 to +25** (not discrete modes). The CEO sets a **target** via the sector settings panel; the active level trends toward the target at 1 unit per turn.

- **Positive values (up to +25):** Higher output volume, lower margins, grows revenue faster ("Aggressive")
- **Zero:** Balanced default ("Normal")
- **Negative values (down to -25):** Lower output, higher margins, preserves profitability ("Conservative")

The UI displays these as Aggressive / Normal / Conservative labels, but the underlying mechanic is the continuous scale. Revenue and margin multipliers are applied via `getRevenueMultiplier(policyLevel)`.

- **DB fields:** `CorporateSector.productionPolicy` (target, -25 to 25), `CorporateSector.productionPolicyLevel` (current active level)

## Economic Effects

### Unemployment -> Profit Margin (implemented)

State unemployment modifies corporate sector profit margins by up to ±5%:

- **Below 3% unemployment:** Tight labor market squeezes margins (linear to -5% at 0%)
- **At 3%:** No modifier (pivot point)
- **Above 3%:** Cheap labor boosts margins (linear to +5% at 10%+)

Formula: `getUnemploymentMarginModifier(unemploymentRate)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Corporate-Driven GDP Growth (implemented)

State GDP growth is computed as a revenue-weighted average of owned corporate sectors' growth rates. States with no owned sectors show N/A. National GDP growth uses GDP-weighted averaging.

Formula: `updateCorporateDrivenGdpGrowth(db)` in `src/lib/turn/corporateGdpGrowth.ts`

### Power Grid Reliability -> Profit Margin (implemented)

Gated effect: no impact when grid uptime is above 95%. Below 95%, linear penalty scaling to -4% at 85% or lower. Affects ALL sectors, every business needs electricity.

- **Above 95%:** 0% modifier (grid is reliable enough)
- **85-95%:** Linear scale from 0% to -4%
- **Below 85%:** Capped at -4%

Formula: `getGridReliabilityMarginModifier(reliability)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Corruption -> Profit Margin (implemented)

Higher corruption increases costs from bribes, unpredictable enforcement, regulatory shakedowns, and contract uncertainty. Affects ALL sectors.

- **At 0 corruption:** 0% modifier
- **Linear scale to -3% at corruption index 100**

Formula: `getCorruptionMarginModifier(corruptionIndex)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### All Profit Margin Modifiers (implemented)

A single source of truth function `computeAllMarginModifiers()` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts` computes all modifiers for both display and turn processing.

| Modifier          | Max Effect       | Sectors Affected                                                                             | Threshold/Pivot                         |

### Home Location Bonus (implemented)

Sectors in the corporation's HQ state receive a **+10% margin bonus**. Sectors in the same country as the HQ (but a different state) receive a **+5% bonus**. Sectors in a foreign country receive no home location bonus. Stacks additively with all other modifiers.

- **HQ state:** `HOME_STATE_MARGIN_BONUS = 10`
- **Same country:** `HOME_NATION_MARGIN_BONUS = 5`

Function: `getHomeLocationMarginBonus()` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Inflation → Profit Margin (implemented)

Country-level inflation modifies all corporate sector margins. The target rate is 2.0%. Deflation and low inflation provide a modest bonus; high inflation significantly hurts margins.

- **At target (2%):** 0% modifier
- **Below 2%:** Bonus up to +2% at 0% inflation
- **Above 2%:** Linear penalty scaling to **-8% at 10%+ inflation**
- **Applies to all sectors at country level**

Function: `getInflationMarginModifier(inflationRate)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Debt-to-GDP → Profit Margin (implemented)

High sovereign debt crowds out private investment, raising borrowing costs and reducing confidence. Applies to all sectors at country level.

- **Below 50% D/GDP:** No modifier
- **50%-100% D/GDP:** Linear penalty, -0.5% per 10 percentage points of debt
- **Above 100% D/GDP:** -2.5% base + additional -1% per 10 pp over 100%, **capped at -5%** (`DEBT_TO_GDP_MAX_PENALTY`; loosened from an earlier -15% floor because the modifier is a feedback loop, lower margins cut corporate tax, which widens the deficit and raises debt further, and -15% was pinning most firms at the floor permanently)

Function: `getDebtToGdpMarginModifier()` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Deficit-to-GDP → Profit Margin (implemented)

Government deficit spending acts as a short-term economic stimulus, boosting business activity across all sectors. Applies at country level.

- **Modifier:** +0.5% per 1% of GDP deficit
- **Cap:** +5% maximum
- **Surplus budgets provide no bonus**

Function: `getDeficitToGdpMarginModifier()` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Sector Type Match / Mismatch (implemented)

Sectors that match the parent corporation's primary type receive a **+5% margin bonus**. Sectors matching the **secondary type** (if set) receive **+2.5%**. All other sectors receive a **-15% penalty**. This encourages focused corporations while allowing some diversification via secondary type.

Formula: `getSectorTypeMatchModifier(sectorType, corporationType, secondaryType?)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Secondary Corporation Type (implemented)

Corporations can declare a **secondary sector focus** from the CEO page. This provides a half-strength sector type match bonus (+2.5%) for sectors of the secondary type, but doubles the base sprawl penalty from -0.5% to -1.0% per pair over 15 sectors. Logistics spending still reduces the effective penalty. The secondary type cannot be the same as the primary type and can be cleared by setting it to "None".

- **DB field:** `Corporation.secondaryType?: CorporationType | null`
- **Settings API:** `POST /api/corporations/[id]/settings` accepts `secondaryType` and `primaryType`

### Type Switching Penalty (implemented)

Changing the primary or secondary corporation type incurs a **-10% margin penalty** on ALL sectors for **24 hours** (`TYPE_SWITCH_PENALTY_TURNS = 24`), followed by a **48-hour cooldown** (`TYPE_SWITCH_COOLDOWN_TURNS = 48`) before another type change is allowed. The total lockout is 72 hours (penalty + cooldown).

- **DB fields:** `Corporation.typeSwitchTurn`, `Corporation.typeSwitchCooldownUntilTurn`
- **Turn processor:** Checks `typeSwitchTurn` against current turn to apply penalty
- **Settings API:** Enforces cooldown, rejects changes during cooldown period

### Logistical Sprawl Penalty (implemented)

Corporations with more than **15 sectors** incur a **-0.5% margin penalty for every 2 sectors** over the threshold (doubled to **-1.0%** if a secondary type is set). A corporation with 15 or fewer sectors has no penalty. Logistics spending reduces both the threshold and penalty slope:

- At LS 0: threshold 15, penalty -0.5% per pair (or -1.0% with secondary type)
- At LS 200 (max): threshold 30, penalty halved (-0.25% or -0.5%)
- Linear interpolation between 0 and 200

Formula: `getSprawlModifier(totalSectors, logisticsStrength?, hasSecondaryType?)` in `src/lib/constants/corporations.ts`

### Planned Sector Effects

Future state metric effects (not yet implemented):

| Metric            | Effect                                                     | Sectors Affected                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Population Growth | +0-2% revenue growth bonus                                 | Retail, Real Estate, Healthcare, Agriculture |
| Renewable Energy  | -3% energy margin, +2% manufacturing margin at high levels | Energy, Manufacturing                        |
| Income Inequality | +2% financial margin, -2% retail revenue when high         | Financial, Retail                            |

## Commodity Market (implemented)

22 commodity types trade between sectors: Steel, Electronics, Energy (Electricity), Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Fertilizers, Food, Building Materials, Construction Services, Healthcare Services, Real Estate Services, Software, Financial Services, Advertising, Vehicles, Consumer Goods (retail), Freight, Consulting Services, Iron Ore, Coal, Crude Oil, and Rare Earth Minerals.

### Supply & Demand

Each sector type supplies and demands specific commodities at defined rates (fraction of daily revenue). Retail demands all commodities as inputs and also supplies the "Consumer Goods" (`retail`) commodity (rate 0.5). Retail input demand is scaled by GDP growth (50% national + 50% regional). Consumer demand for the retail commodity is also GDP-driven: demand = retail supply × GDP multiplier, so positive GDP growth pushes retail prices up and negative GDP shrinks them. Only owned sectors participate.

Retail sectors face only 25% of negative commodity input penalties (`RETAIL_NEGATIVE_COMMODITY_PENALTY_FACTOR = 0.25`), reflecting their ability to substitute or absorb supply chain shortages. Positive modifiers (oversupply benefits) are unaffected.

Units: `units = (sector daily revenue × rate) / basePrice`

### Dynamic Pricing

Market price = `basePrice × clamp(demand / supply, 0.5, 2.0)`

Blended price per state = 75% global price + 25% regional (state-level) price.

Prices recalculate each turn via `processCommodityPriceTurn()`.

### Margin Modifiers (Logarithmic)

Both input cost penalties and output demand bonuses use the same symmetric logarithmic curve:

```
modifier = K × Σ(rate_i × ln(demand_i / supply_i))
```

Where `K = COMMODITY_LOG_K = 40` (`src/lib/constants/commodities.ts`).

**Buyers (input costs):** Modifier is negated, shortage raises costs, oversupply lowers them.
**Sellers (output demand):** Modifier is positive, shortage boosts margins, oversupply compresses them.

Reference values (single commodity, rate = 1.0):

| D/S Ratio     | Modifier |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 0.5×          | ∓27.7%   |
| 1× (balanced) | 0%       |
| 1.5×          | ±16.2%   |
| 2×            | ±27.7%   |
| 3×            | ±43.9%   |
| 5×            | ±64.4%   |
| 10×           | ±92.1%   |

The logarithmic curve is self-balancing (diminishing returns) and uncapped. Near-zero supply is floored at demand/1000 to avoid infinity.

- `src/lib/turn/commodityPriceTurn.ts`, Per-turn price calculation and history snapshots
- `src/app/commodity/[type]/page.tsx`, Commodity detail page with price chart
- `src/app/api/commodities/`, Commodity API routes

## Operating Strategies (implemented)

Each sector type has 3-4 operating strategies that alter its commodity supply and demand rates. Every sector defaults to "Standard" but can be switched by the CEO.

### Switching

- **Cost:** 25% of sector daily revenue (`STRATEGY_RETOOL_COST_FRACTION`)
- **Transition:** 12 turns with a **-5% margin penalty** during transition. Supply/demand rates linearly interpolate from old to new strategy over the transition period.
- **Cooldown:** 24 turns after transition completes before another change is allowed.

### Strategy Confirmation

The strategy switch confirmation panel shows:

- Per-commodity comparison (old vs new output/input rates)
- Current market status per commodity (surplus/balanced/shortage)
- Estimated commodity margin impact (before vs after)

### Key Files

- `src/lib/constants/sectorStrategies.ts`, All strategy definitions, transition/cooldown constants, effective rate interpolation

## Shares & Dividends

### Share Trading

Players can buy and sell shares from the Shares tab on any corporation page:

- **Market orders:** Instant buy/sell at current market price via a public float market maker
- **Limit orders:** Place buy/sell orders at a target price; filled automatically each turn when the market price crosses the limit
- **Escrow:** Buy orders hold funds in escrow; sell orders reserve shares until filled or cancelled
- **Public float:** Shares available for purchase. Increased by CEO issuance and sell orders; decreased by buy orders

### CEO Share Issuance

- **Public issuance:** Issue up to 50% of outstanding shares to the public float (dilution)
- **Self-issuance:** Issue shares to the CEO at a 15% premium; proceeds go to corporate liquid capital
- **Stock split & reverse split:** The CEO may set a new `targetTotalShares` via `POST /api/corporations/[id]/shares/consolidate`. **All shareholders and `publicFloat` are scaled in proportion** (largest-remainder integer split) so ownership percentages stay the same; `sharePrice`, `lastTradePrice`, and `reportedSharePrice` scale so **market cap is unchanged**. **Reverse split:** new total from **1,000,000** (`SHARE_CONSOLIDATION_MIN_TOTAL_SHARES`) up to current−1. **Forward split:** new total from current+1 up to **100×** current (`MAX_FORWARD_SHARE_SPLIT_MULTIPLIER`). **Cooldown:** `SHARE_STRUCTURE_COOLDOWN_TURNS` (48) between changes; stored on `Corporation.lastShareStructureTurn`. **Open `shareOrders`:** any open orders on the corporation are **auto-cancelled and fully refunded** as part of the restructure (buy-side escrow → placer corp / character wallet; corp sell-side reserved shares → placer shareholder entry) so third-party limit orders cannot block a restructure indefinitely. The response includes `cancelledOpenOrders`. State-owned / nationalized corporations cannot use this.

### Shareholder Governance Votes

Public corporations use `corporationVotes` for governance changes, HQ relocation, dissolution authorization, and public share issuance. The CEO opens a vote via `POST /api/corporations/[id]/votes`; each cast ballot carries a `voteShares` weight equal to the voter's current holdings.

- **Window:** 24 turns from proposal.
- **Threshold:** `legalStructure.shareholderVoteThreshold`, evaluated against total eligible shares.
- **Early pass:** yes shares reach the threshold.
- **Early fail:** yes shares plus all remaining unvoted shares can no longer reach the threshold.
- **Deadline:** if still uncertain, the deadline tally determines pass/fail.
- **Turn sweep:** `processVoteAutoResolve()` runs during `processCorporationTurn()` and is awaited before the turn returns, so votes finalize even without a vote-detail GET.
- **Atomic claim:** `resolveCorporationVoteIfReady()` flips `{ status: "open" }` to the terminal status with an atomic update and returns `claimed`; only the winning resolver applies effects and notifications.
- **Passed effects:** governance changes update legal structure and cooldown, relocation updates HQ/country and cancels incompatible open votes, share issuance increases `totalShares`, `publicFloat`, and `liquidCapital`, and dissolution unlocks the execute-dissolution route.

### Dividends

- **Rate:** 0-100% of pre-dividend income, set by CEO
- **Cooldown:** 24-hour change cooldown (`dividendRateChangedAt`)
- **Distribution:** Paid pro-rata to all shareholders each turn
- **Source:** Deducted from corporate income before liquid capital update

### CEO election (shareholder vote)

When the CEO office is contested, **each shareholder casts at most one ballot choice**, but the tally is **weighted by shares**: a voter with 500 shares contributes 500 votes to their chosen candidate (not one vote per holder). You may vote for yourself if you are a candidate. Eligible **candidates** must reside in the corporation's **headquarters state** (same rule as accepting the CEO role).

### Share Price Formula

**Entry point:** `src/lib/turn/corporation/sectorCalculations.ts` (share price block after sector loop)

Blended share price = 15% momentum + 60% balance sheet + 25% income (capped)

```typescript
// 1. Balance sheet equity per share (₳ anchor; portfolio matches corporation GET financials)
const portfolioAnchor = portfolioAnchorValueByCorpId.get(corpId) ?? 0;
// portfolioAnchor = held bond mark-to-market + cross-corp stock (shares × issuer quote)
//   + IMF facility principal receivable for IMF lender corps
const balanceSheetEquity =
  liquidCapital + income + sectorNPV + portfolioAnchor - imfFacilityPaymentAdjust;
const balanceSheetPrice = balanceSheetEquity / totalShares;

// 2. Income-based valuation (capped to prevent runaway P/E)
const annualIncome = incomePreDividends * TURNS_PER_YEAR;
const rawIncomePrice = (annualIncome / totalShares) * SHARE_PRICE_PE_MULTIPLE;
const incomePrice = Math.min(rawIncomePrice, balanceSheetPrice * INCOME_PRICE_CAP_MULTIPLE);

// 3. Blended price with momentum smoothing
const newSharePrice = 0.15 * prevPrice + 0.6 * balanceSheetPrice + 0.25 * incomePrice;
```

**Constants:**

| Constant                    | Value | Description                          |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| `SHARE_PRICE_PE_MULTIPLE`   | 6     | P/E multiple for income valuation    |
| `INCOME_PRICE_CAP_MULTIPLE` | 4     | Income price capped at 4× book value |
| `MIN_SHARE_PRICE`           | $0.01 | Hard floor on share price            |
| `NPV_ANNUAL_DISCOUNT_RATE`  | 0.15  | 15% discount rate for sector NPV     |

**Momentum:** 15% of previous price prevents volatile swings

**Income cap:** Prevents hyper-profitable corporations from infinite valuation

### Collections

- **`shareOrders`**, Limit order documents (type, price, shares, escrow, status)

## Bonds

Corporations can issue bonds to raise capital. Bonds are fixed-income debt instruments.

### Bond Issuance

- **Minimum issuance:** $100,000
- **Maximum:** Total debt cannot exceed 2× equity
- **Maturity options:** 48 turns (1yr), 96 turns (2yr), 240 turns (5yr), 336 turns (7yr)
- **Coupon rate:** `primeRate + creditRatingSpread + CORPORATE_BOND_SPREAD_PREMIUM (1.0pp) + termPremium`. Term premium by maturity: 48/96 turns = 0, 240 turns = +1.0pp, 336 turns = +1.75pp.
- **Cooldown:** `BOND_ISSUANCE_COOLDOWN_TURNS` between issuances
- **Unit size:** $1,000 face value per unit (`BOND_UNIT_FACE_VALUE`)

### Credit Rating

Composite score (0-100) from four components:

- Debt-to-equity ratio
- Interest coverage ratio
- Profitability
- Liquidity

Rating determines the credit spread added to the prime rate for the coupon.

### Bond Trading

- Players and corporations can buy bond units from the public float at market price
- CEOs can buy for their corporation via `?corporationId=` query param
- Sellers can sell holdings back; issuers can buyback
- Market price fluctuates based on credit conditions

### Distressed Debt Trading

- **Defaulted bonds can be bought** by any player or corporation on the open market
- **CEO self-buy blocked**, CEOs cannot buy their own corporation's defaulted bonds (prevents self-dealing exploit)
- **CEO buyback at face value**, CEOs can retire defaulted bond units from the public float at full face value ($1,000/unit) via the "Retire Debt" panel on the bond detail page, allowing gradual debt reduction
- **Auto-maturity**, Bonds automatically mature when all units (public float + holders) are fully retired

### Bond Holdings

The bonds API returns `holdings`, bonds the corporation owns in other companies, with issuer names, units, market values.

### Collections

- **`bonds`**, Bond documents (corporationId, couponRate, maturityTurn, marketPrice, holders[], publicFloat)
- **`bondHistory`**, Per-turn snapshots (marketPrice, totalInterestPaid)

### Key Files

- `src/lib/db/types/bond.ts`, `Bond`, `BondHolder`, `CorporateCreditRating` interfaces
- `src/lib/constants/bonds.ts`, Credit scoring, coupon rate calculation

- `src/app/api/corporations/[id]/bonds/route.ts`, Issuance and holdings
- `src/app/bond/[id]/page.tsx`, Bond detail page with buy panel

## National Corporations

National corporations are government-owned enterprises that operate within the budget system. They are not player-founded and cannot be attacked or acquired.

### Characteristics

- **Sequential IDs:** National corporations have system-assigned sequential IDs and use URL fallbacks for display
- **Market share cap:** National corporation market share is hard-capped at 100% to prevent display errors
- **Attack protection:** Players cannot use economic attack actions against national corporations
- **Budget integration:** National corp revenue is refreshed each turn and displayed in treasury/budget panels
- **Sector display:** National corporations appear alongside private corporations on sector and corporation listing pages

### UK Public Healthcare (NHS)

The UK has an NHS-style public healthcare corporation seeded at game setup. Healthcare sectors are sized appropriately for the UK economy and appear in the UK treasury panel alongside other government spending categories.

## Sovereign Bonds

Governments can issue sovereign debt instruments, extending the corporate bond system to national-level finance.

- **Issuance:** Sovereign bonds are issued via admin routes with debt-driven demand mechanics
- **Demand:** Bond demand scales with national debt levels, higher debt increases demand for sovereign instruments
- **Display:** Sovereign bonds appear on country stock exchange pages alongside corporate bonds
- **Admin testing:** A test issuance route (`/api/admin/sovereign-debt/`) allows admins to create sovereign bond instruments for testing

### Key Files

- `src/app/api/admin/sovereign-debt/`, Sovereign debt test issuance route
- `src/app/api/bonds/`, Shared bond trading infrastructure (corporate + sovereign)

## Sector Production Modes

Sectors can operate in one of three production modes, configurable by the CEO:

| Mode             | Effect                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Normal**       | Default balanced operation                                   |
| **Aggressive**   | Higher output volume, lower margins, grow revenue faster    |
| **Conservative** | Lower output volume, higher margins, preserve profitability |

Mode changes are subject to a transition cooldown. Cooldown timer starts at transition initiation and displays countdown badges on sector cards showing time remaining until the switch completes.

## HQ Relocation

CEOs can relocate corporate headquarters to another state or region (including in another country) via `POST /api/corporations/[id]/relocate`. This changes the corporation's tax jurisdiction, home-nation sector bonuses, and coupon-rate calculations on future bonds.

- **Cost:** 7% of market capitalization in-country; **14% (2×)** for cross-country moves. Payable from corp Liquid Capital or a 7-year bond (subject to bond cooldown + 2× equity leverage cap).
- **Country update:** Cross-country moves update `corporation.countryId` alongside `headquartersState`.
- **CEO residency:** If the CEO's `homeState` does not match the new HQ state after the move, the corporation's `ceoVacant` is set to `true` and `ceoId` / `userId` are unset, shareholders can then elect a new CEO who lives there. The UI warns the player before submission; the action is not blocked.

Players who are CEOs can also combine their own relocation with a corp HQ move via the region-page "Relocate here" button (see [[Relocation]], "Combined character + corporation relocation"). In that flow the CEO role is preserved because the character ends up at the new HQ.

### Treasury and sector revenue on cross-country relocation

When a cross-country HQ move crosses a currency boundary (e.g. UK → JP), the corp's treasury and sector economics convert from the source currency to the destination currency at the spot FX rate at time of submission:

- **Corp fields rescaled:** `liquidCapital`, `sharePrice`, `marketingBudget`, `logisticsBudget`, `ceoSalary`. `liquidCurrencyCode` updates to the new country's currency.
- **All sectors owned by the corp:** `revenue` and `currentGrowthCost` rescaled by the same factor. Sector country-of-operation (`sector.countryId`) does not change, it's decoupled from the owner's HQ country.
- **Conversion math:** `LOCAL_new = LOCAL_old × (toRate / fromRate)`. Anchor-preserving, total ₳ value unchanged by the conversion itself.
- **No FX fee / spread.** The 14% market-cap cross-country relocation cost is the economic friction; adding an FX haircut would double-penalize.

**What does NOT convert:**

- **Existing bonds** (see below, denomination fixed at issuance).
- **Historical rows** (`corporationHistory`, `marketCapHistory`, `corporationPortfolioHistory`), each row stamped with its own `currencyCode` at write time, so mixed-currency rows across the conversion moment chart correctly.
- **Character wallets**, multi-currency by design.
- **Same-country moves** (e.g. CA → NY, both USD), no-op.
- **Moves to a country with the same currency as the corp's current** (e.g. US corp → CA, both USD), no-op.

**Open share orders + listings cancelled on conversion.** Escrow amounts are denominated in the old currency; the cancel-refund helpers read the corp's current `liquidCurrencyCode` to interpret them, so the conversion must happen AFTER cancellation. Escrow refunds route through the standard share-order / share-listing cancel paths (buyers get their money back in their own native currency). The player is responsible for re-placing orders in the new currency after the move.

**New relocation bond (if selected as payment method) stamps in the NEW currency.** The bond is issued after the conversion completes, so `resolveCorpLiquidCurrencyCode(corporation)` at stamping time returns the destination currency.

**Pre-forex corps (no `liquidCurrencyCode`) are backfilled.** Source rate defaults to 1.0 (₳ passthrough), new currency gets stamped.

All three HQ-move paths converge on the same converter:

- Player `POST /api/corporations/[id]/relocate` (cash or bond)
- Combined character + corp `POST /api/character/relocate-with-corp`
- Admin `PATCH /api/admin/corporations/[id]/hq`

### Bond denomination on relocation

Bonds retain their original `currencyCode` on any relocation, player-initiated (same-country only) **and** admin-initiated cross-country HQ moves via `PATCH /api/admin/corporations/[id]/hq`. A JPY-denominated corporate bond pays JPY coupons and returns JPY face value at maturity for its entire life, regardless of subsequent HQ moves. This matches real-world bond contracts (denomination fixed at issuance) and keeps `bond.totalIssued`, coupon cash-flows, and market price fluctuations all denominated in the single currency the bond was issued in.

Concretely, post-Task-18B `bond.currencyCode` is the canonical FX key for every bond cash-flow path: turn-processing coupon payouts, maturity face-value payouts, issuer deductions, buy/sell/buyback routes, portfolio valuations, credit scoring, and net-worth aggregation. Code paths must resolve a bond's currency from `bond.currencyCode` (falling back to `COUNTRY_CURRENCY_MAP[bond.countryId]` only for pre-migration rows) and never from the issuing corp's current `countryId`.

## Shareholder Address

CEOs can broadcast a formatted message to all current shareholders as system notifications.

- **Access**: CEO Office > Admin subtab on the corporation page
- **Cooldown**: 12 hours per corporation (enforced via `lastShareholderAddressAt`)
- **Delivery**: Batched shareholder userId lookup via `characters.find`; sent as system notifications
- **UI**: Uses the Mail Composer Modal in `shareholder-address` mode

## CEO Residence Rules

- **Founding:** Corporation HQ is set to the founder's `homeState`
- **Acceptance gate:** Character must have `homeState === corporation.headquartersState` to accept a CEO offer (returns 400 otherwise)
- **Character relocation auto-resign:** If a character relocates without the combined character+corp flow, the corporation's `ceoVacant` is set to `true` and `ceoId` / `userId` are unset, regardless of whether the country changed.
- **Combined character+corp relocation:** If the player uses the region-page "Relocate & Move Corporation" option, both move together and the CEO role is preserved (`performRelocation` is called with `skipCeoResignForCorpId`).
- **HQ-side auto-vacate:** When the HQ moves via the CEO Office and the CEO does not reside at the new HQ state, the CEO seat is auto-vacated.
- **UI warnings:** RelocateButton shows the full effects list on region-page confirm; the CEO Office flow shows an amber warning when the destination differs from the CEO's home state.

## CEO Tab Organization

The CEO Office tab on the corporation page is organized into subtabs:

| Subtab               | Contents                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Overview**         | Corporation summary, sector list, key metrics                   |
| **Budget Dashboard** | Revenue and cost breakdowns per sector, net income analysis     |
| **Settings**         | Dividend rate, growth rates, production modes, share management |

Admin-facing sector cards include +/- buttons for manual growth rate adjustment.

## Stock Exchange

Corporations are listed on country-specific exchanges:

- **NYSE** (`/stockmarket/us`), US-headquartered corporations
- **FTSE** (`/stockmarket/uk`), UK-headquartered corporations

Exchange pages display: market cap, share price, total revenue, income, CEO info, sector type, and headquarters. Price history is visualized with **OHLC candlestick charts** showing open, high, low, and close prices per period.

## Discord Bot Integration

API routes supporting Discord bot queries:

- `GET /api/discord-bot/corporation?name=`, Look up a corporation by name
- `GET /api/discord-bot/sectors?state=&type=`, Query sectors by state and/or type
- `GET /api/discord-bot/stock-chart`, Market-wide or per-corporation price history chart data (optional corporation and country filters)

## Currency storage (v0.2.6)

Every corp-economic money field is stored in the corp's `liquidCurrencyCode`. Cross-corp aggregation (global market cap, commodity flows, stockmarket totals) anchor-normalizes via `readCorpEconomicAnchor` / `sumAsAnchor`; intra-corp math stays unit-preserving. UI renders via `formatAmount(anchorValue, nativeCurrencyCode)` so the wallet preference (internal / home / pinned / local) is a display-time concern only.

| Domain                                                                                         | Stored in                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Corp fields (`liquidCapital`, `marketingBudget`, `logisticsBudget`, `ceoSalary`, `sharePrice`) | `corporation.liquidCurrencyCode`                                                       |
| Sector fields (`revenue`, `currentGrowthCost`)                                                 | parent corp's `liquidCurrencyCode` (not the state's currency)                          |
| Corporate bond face value / coupon / `totalIssued`                                             | `bond.currencyCode` (stamped at issuance from issuing corp's `liquidCurrencyCode`)     |
| Tax bases written from corp turn (`corporateProfits`, `taxableSales`)                          | country's currency (corp turn accumulates in ₳ then multiplies by country FX at write) |
| Cross-corp aggregates (global GDP, global market cap, commodity demand)                        | computed in ₳; displayed via wallet preference                                         |
| `sharePriceFormula` intermediate                                                               | ₳ (anchor), converted to corp-local at persistence boundary                           |
| `corporationHistory`, `marketCapHistory`, `corporationPortfolioHistory` money columns          | corp's `liquidCurrencyCode` at time of write (`currencyCode` stamped on each row)      |

**History backfill (option 3):** the v0.2.6 migration rescales every existing history row at **today's** FX rate so charts stay visually continuous across the migration moment. Historical FX accuracy is intentionally sacrificed.

**Migration scripts** (idempotent via `migrationsRun` markers, run in order):

- `scripts/migrations/corpEconomyToLocalCurrency.ts`
- `scripts/migrations/bondCurrencyStamp.ts`

See `scripts/migrations/README.md` for the dry-run checklist.
