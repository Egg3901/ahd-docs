# A House Divided - Game Design Documentation

> **Note:** These design documents were written during early planning. Some
> technical details may differ from the current implementation. The app uses a
> single Next.js stack. See the `README` and `CHANGELOG` in the
> a-house-divided app repo, and

## Overview

A House Divided is a real-time political simulation game where players create
characters, join parties, and compete for political office across active country
simulations. The current runtime supports the US, UK, Japan, and Germany through
shared country configuration and country-specific political rules.

## Core Concept

Players control individual politicians making decisions and building coalitions.
The game operates in real time with compressed political cycles. The US baseline
uses:

- **Presidential Term**: 8 days
- **Senate Term**: 12 days (3 staggered classes)
- **House Term**: 4 days

Parliamentary countries use their own configured cycles, confidence mechanics,
snap-election rules, and vacancy handling.

## Game World

- **Scope**: Active country simulations for US, UK, JP, and DE, with
  regional/state structures where configured
- **Persistence**: Continuous server-based world
- **Player Count**: NPPs (Non-Player Politicians) fill seats, enter elections,
  and hold office; game functions meaningfully regardless of player count
